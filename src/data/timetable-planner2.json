Eliot&rsquo;s Waste Land; novels and how their social function and meaning vary from Joseph Conrad&rsquo;s Heart of Darkness to Amruta Patil&rsquo;s Kari; lyric poetry and how its modes of intimacy have transformed from Sappho&rsquo;s fragments, Amir Khusro&rsquo;s ghazals, and William Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets to Audre Lorde&rsquo;s poetry; drama and how its representation of gender has morphed from Kalidasa&rsquo;s Shakuntala to Caryl Churchill&rsquo;s Top Girls; and short stories and how their uncanny imaginative scope has been reconfigured from E.

Our focus on the making of these genres will allow us some freedom in the worlds we roam&mdash;from the classical to the contemporary, traversing many parts of the globe through different literary cultures.</p>\n\n<p>In thinking through form historically, we will begin by assuming that literary genres articulate the material foundations we recognize in their social and historical contexts. We will trace how the evolution and sedimentation of these forms reflects the conditions of their making. Along the way, we&rsquo;ll think about the many ways in which human beings have considered their place in the world, about what it means to be, live, love, act, work, desire, write and create&mdash;questions that seem to reach out from the particular places and times in which they are asked, even as they tell us all the more about how those places and times were inhabited and imagined.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our readings will include epic texts like The Odyssey and Paradise Lost; drama that includes both Sophocles&rsquo; Antigone and Bertolt Brecht&rsquo;s Mother Courage and Her Children; works by Chaucer and T. S. Eliot, poetry from down the ages and across the globe, including Sappho and Du Fu, Shakespeare and Kabir, Langston Hughes and Meena Kandasamy; and fictional writing that includes story cycles from earlier eras, some of the great short stories of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and a novella.

Did it get created in classical antiquity? Or was it a product of the colonial encounter? Discussions about Indian civilization are usually attentive to antiquity, or to what has been labelled as a &lsquo;composite culture&rsquo; fostered by the advent of Islam in medieval times. This course will suggest that the term &lsquo;composite culture&rsquo; is perhaps more appropriate to describe the modern Indian living conditions, habits and identities which burgeoned during British rule, and have flourished thereafter. It addresses the making of modern Indian civilization, not so much by looking at a distant past, but by examining developments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We shall discuss politics and economics, but also &ndash; among other topics &ndash; food and dress, technology and health, the adoption of new technologies, and new items of mass consumption. To a greater extent than many people wish to admit, we are constituted by colonialism. Even the drinking of tea and coffee, so much a part of our culture now, dates to our relatively recent past, and provides a fascinating history to explore.</p>\n</div></div>",

In the process, the course will explore a varied and rich tapestry that includes rock art, the Harappan Civilization, the Mahabharata&rsquo;s many stories, the iconic emperors Ashoka and Akbar,&nbsp; and the words of the Buddha and the &nbsp; Bhakti saints. Indian civilization, as the course will emphasize, is not to be seen merely as part of the dead past but as an element that continued to be invoked in present times, by literary giants like Rabindranath Tagore and statesmen like Jawaharlal Nehru, and by more ordinary people in India&rsquo;s villages and towns.

Every conversation, every memory, even your reading of this course outline, structurally and functionally changes your brain, but not everything that the brain processes seems to make it to the realm of conscious perception. We will think about various seemingly intangible aspects of the mind and try to imagine how to make sense of them. The goal of the course is to provide you with the tools with which to ask these questions and begin answering them.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will take a look at complex and interesting phenomena such as motivation, emotion, language, consciousness and attention. We will explore the specific question of how we learn, how we absorb and retain new material, the ways in which our brains tend to conflate correlation and causation, how we make decisions, and what critical thinking means. We will think through inter individual behavioural differences and what kinds of evidence we require to draw conclusions about group behaviour. We will focus on the limitations of what we collectively understand and the ways in which we might imagine advancing our collective knowledge about the mind and behaviour.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>-</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>-</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Your graded assessments are composed of:</p>\n\n<p>30% Quizzes: 6&nbsp;quizzes: 5% each</p>\n\n<p>20% Initial hypothesis proposal</p>\n\n<p>30% Final hypothesis testing proposal</p>\n\n<p>20% Participation: 10% DS attendance, 5% DS participation, 2% class participation, 3% class attendance</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Attendance will be scored as: Number of classes attended/(Total number of classes-3) normalised to 3 points, and will be likewise calculated for DSes.</p>\n\n<p>The TAs will keep a track of attendance.

All those who want additional excused absences if they are unable to attend classes due to medical reasons (either their own or for anything involving caregiving for a loved one) are requested to email the TAs (and CC the TFs, but please not Bittu), with a copy of their medical note (with the date clearly mentioned) along with their emails.

This is an introduction to logic as a resource for philosophy, though it should benefit many who do not mean to make philosophy their primary subject of study. Logic is concerned with truth; in learning it, we learn to evaluate how well our thoughts and arguments are tied to truth. We will study several artificial formal languages, especially first-order propositional and predicate logic, as well as modal ogic. We will think about their relation to the natural language of English, and to the world, as it is independent of all our speech.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>II: Learning Objectives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>\n\n<p>Understand the fundamental ideas of logic.</p>\n\n<p>Translate sentences of English into well-formed sentences of logical languages, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Determine the formal properties of arguments, such as validity and soundness,&nbsp; as they are used in philosophical writing and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Construct formal proofs for sentences of our formal languages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Recognise some of the philosophical implications and applications of logic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>III: What to Expect. This is a demanding course, covering a good deal of challenging technical ground. It is still an introductory course, intended primarily to prepare philosophers for work across that subject. It is not an advanced course, exploring the field of logic for its own sake, in the manner of an advanced metaphysics course. But as an introductory logic course, it is more advanced than most (including, for instance, the logic course offered by the excellent department at Leeds, in Britain&rsquo;s prestigious Russell Group). Some of the topics covered towards the end are at the edge of active research. You will have to work hard, and you may well feel yourself struggling at times. If you are prepared to put in the work, and square up to the struggle, you will learn a lot, and be equipped both to follow and create philosophical arguments at the highest level.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>IV: Resources. The main texts we will be working from are Volker Halbach&rsquo;s The Logic Manual and Ted Sider&rsquo;s Logic for Philosophy, as well as my Modal Logic Manual. There are also plenty of free online resources you may draw upon for the earlier sections of the course, too. See eg the materials developed by Tim Button, as well as Garson&rsquo;s Modal Logic for Philosophers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>V: Plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 1 &amp; 2: What is logic, and what do we want from it?</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 1</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 3: Syntax and semantics of propositional&nbsp; logic</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manuel 2</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 4: Formalization in propositional logic</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 3</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 5: Syntax of predicate logic</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 4</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 6: Semantics of predicate logic</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 5</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 7: Natural deduction</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 6</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 8: Formalization and Identity</p>\n\n<p>See Logic Manual 7 &amp; 8</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 9: Review and Exam</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 9: Introduction to Modal Propositional Logic</p>\n\n<p>See Modal Logic Manual 1 and 2</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 10: Semantic Proof for Modal Logic&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>See Logic for Philosophers 9</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 11: Natural Deduction for Modal Logic</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Week 12: Review&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>VI: Assessment</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We we will have periodic homework assignments, as well as two exams, one around the middle and one at the end of the course.

The course will cover fundamental theories relative to cognitive development, moral development, language development, identity formation etc from the period of the prenatal period to death. During the course, students will engage in key theoretical concepts in human development and their cultural application, critique the idea of normative development and develop a grounded sensibility towards development oriented concerns and challenges. The course will follow a critically reflexive pedagogy, urging students to consistently question developmental givens, introspect on their development and hence develop a nuanced understanding of technical concepts. Pedagogical tools will include a combination of play, reflexive exercises, art work and film clippings. The course intends to&nbsp; ask the following questions: How do nature and nurture together shape development? How do children shape their own development? In what ways is development continuous, and in what ways is it discontinuous? How does the socio-cultural context influence development? What are the ethical research practices when studying developmental patterns?</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>Develop a thorough understanding of major development theories.</li>\n\t<li>Develop a critical approach to linear models of human development.</li>\n\t<li>Relate key concepts of the scientific method to research in child development.</li>\n\t<li>Identify and illustrate how biological, cognitive and social-emotional processes interact to influence human development.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Course Requirement</strong></p>\n\n<p>Introduction to Psychology/ Thinking like a Psychologist, SRM-I</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course textbooks</strong></p>\n\n<p>Feldman, R.S., &amp; Babu, N.

It is necessary to inculcate holistic thinking on environmental challenges and their purported solutions, that includes concerns of social and ecological sustainability. &nbsp;This course will discuss some of the most current concerns related to the environment, as well as societal responses to them, from a multidisciplinary perspective. Water scarcity, climate change, forest degradation, biological extinction, pollution and agrarian distress are some of the issues that will be studied. This course is intended to familiarise students with environmental problems&nbsp; and engender a holistic perspective in understanding causes and possible solutions through the lens of science and equity. This course will encourage students to synthesize information across a variety of sources.Practically the course will be taught using a combination of lectures, movies, slideshows and in-class discussions. Discussion on assigned readings will engender critical thinking and debate in class. Students will undertake group projects on current case studies (such as river pollution, tiger tourism etc.). Assessments will be based on class tests, group projects and class participation.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>The course will create an awareness of, and sensitivity to the complexities of contemporary environmental challenges;</li>\n\t<li>Students will learn to analyse environmental issues from a multidisciplinary perspective;</li>\n\t<li>Students will learn to think and write analytically about complex issues</li>\n\t<li>They will be taught to synthesize knowledge from different sources including scholarly papers, visual media and local traditional knowledge</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Indicative Readings (list to be updated):</p>\n\n<p>Shahabuddin, G. and K.

With an anchor in with the most idealised representations of nature&mdash;the setting aside of wild, mostly unpeopled spaces&mdash;students will explore how these landscapes, far from being isolated sanctuaries, are deeply embedded within human social, economic, and political systems. With these protected areas at one end, where biodiversity, ecosystem services and their conservation are key ideas, seeking to&nbsp;separate&nbsp;humans from nature seems a reasonable goal. Over the semester, we interrogate this idea of separation as we widen our circle of exploration and examine the nature-human interface at increasingly broader scales in the contexts of agriculture, natural resource extraction, infrastructure and industrial development, urbanisation, and climate change. Through critique, we hope to arrive at the reality that addressing environmental challenges is less about how we separate the natural and human worlds, and much more about how they can better share a single planet.</p>\n\n<p>Weekly themes guide the exploration along an arc that begins with foundational ideas about nature as part-biological-reality and part-cultural-construct, before moving through the dynamics of biodiversity, resource governance, and agriculture as pivotal interfaces between human and natural systems. The course then expands outward to examine the cascading impacts of urbanisation, industrial development, and climate change. At each stage, students will analyse how environmental challenges unfold across interconnected scales, from local ecosystems shaped by traditional practices to global processes driven by industrialisation and policy frameworks. These themes highlight biodiversity as a cornerstone of ecological resilience, agriculture as a key driver of environmental transformation, and urbanisation as both a challenge and an opportunity for sustainable futures. Throughout, the emphasis remains on the tensions and trade-offs inherent in balancing sustainability with equity and justice.</p>\n\n<p>By engaging with the course&rsquo;s interdisciplinary perspectives, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of environmental challenges across scales and contexts. They will learn to critically analyse the interconnectedness of biodiversity, resource governance, agriculture, urbanisation, and climate change, uncovering how these themes are shaped by historical contingencies and power dynamics. The course emphasizes the development of skills to recognise and navigate trade-offs and tensions in environmental decision-making, equipping students to apply frameworks that address sustainability, justice, and resilience. By the end of the course, students should be envision the natural and the human worlds as deeply connected, and contemplate equitable and sustainable future for both.</p>\n\n<p>Tentative Weekly Themes:</p>\n\n<p>1. The Idea of Nature</p>\n\n<p>2. Biodiversity and Conservation</p>\n\n<p>3. Human-Nature Relationships</p>\n\n<p>4. The Commons and Natural Resource Governance</p>\n\n<p>5.

It asks a broad range of questions that are both theoretically and substantially important. What are states and how did they become the primary form of political organization in the world? Why are some states more capable than others? Why are some countries more prosperous than others, is there one or many paths toward economic development? Why is inequality rising across the world? What is ethnicity and nationalism and why is it associated with conflict and violence? What is globalization, and why is it celebrated in the Global South and associated with rising populism in the West? We will integrate theory with case studies from across the world.</p>\n\n<p>As an introductory course, it will also place an equal emphasis on familiarising students with the political science &lsquo;approach&rsquo; to studying politics and society. A thorough understanding of the scientific enquiry will prepare you to expertly read empirical (that is, research that is based on observation) journal articles and books. We will understand the logic of comparing cases to draw inferences in a scientific manner. We will become comfortable with thinking about politics in terms of unit of analysis, independent and dependent variables, and alternative explanations. The course will also explain how political science attempts to reach causality, that is, how evidence is used to make convincing claims that a particular factor &ldquo;causes&rdquo; a phenomenon (state capacity, economic development, civil wars) more significantly than others.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The goals of the course are three-fold. By the end of the course, students should have an overview of some of the major debates in the field of comparative politics. This will prepare students to take advanced courses in political science and other social science departments. Second, the course will reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form. Finally, the course will also augment students&rsquo; intellectual ability to take an informed stand in contemporary political debates and become more consummate readers of news and popular media.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Reading list from the previous iteration of the course.

You will be responsible for reading on the welfare state and I will provide a commentary on dependency theory (for which, readings are optional).</p>\n\n<p>The Samuels (textbook) chapter is divided between description of what a welfare state is, details of welfare states in advanced countries and an analytical section to explain variation in welfare states.

This is the second course in the macroeconomics sequence for first-year MA and PhD students. Having been exposed to ideas and models of macroeconomic growth in Macroeconomics I, this course introduces students to modern macroeconomic theories of&nbsp;Real Business Cycles and New Keynesian Economics. Moreover, the course will focus on the micro-founding behavior of economic agents that is absent in introductory macroeconomics by discussing theories on consumption and saving. Finally, the course will cover models on search and matching, a benchmark of modern macro labor theory.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course consists of both required course materials, and some suggested readings. The recommended textbooks for this course are the following:</p>\n\n<p>Romer, D., Advanced Macroeconomics (4th Edition or later)</p>\n\n<p>Gali, J., Monetary Policy, Inflation, and the Business Cycle - An Introduction to the New Keynesian Framework, Princeton University Press</p>\n\n<p>Ljungqvist, Lars, and Thomas J. Sargent, Recursive macroeconomic theory, MIT Press, 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Students are not required to buy these textbooks. PDF versions are easily available online and should be accessed for reference. You are encouraged to ask the library and consult additional resources.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There is no course attendance policy. However, as&nbsp;MA/PhD students, you are expected to attend&nbsp;lectures regularly. All deadlines are strict. Being regular in class is positively correlated with doing well in the course. Mobile phones (including those in silent mode), tablets, and laptops are strictly prohibited during class. If it is found that anyone is using any of these devices, then the device will need to be submitted to the instructor&rsquo;s desk and will be returned only at the end of the class. If a laptop is necessary for learning in a class, it shall be allowed, and students will be notified of the same.</p>\n</div></div>",

In the first part of the course (oscillations and waves), we shall discuss oscillations and waves in mechanical, electrical and acoustic systems and try to draw parallels between them. At points, we shall try to illustrate similarities between oscillatory behaviours in different systems. Students may get a better understanding of the theoretical treatments of some of the ideas when they perform experiments in PHY-2020 course. In the second part of the course, we shall focus exclusively on electromagnetic waves and their properties with particular emphasis on visible window of electromagnetic waves and its interaction with the matter. The theoretical treatments that you have studied in the last semester (PHY-2210 and PHY-2310) are essential for this course, and this course, in some sense, &nbsp;is a continuation of those two courses at a slightly advanced level. A fair familiarity with calculus is very essential to follow the mathematical treatment of the subject; we shall give a basic introduction to complex exponential representation of waves, Fourier analysis and partial differential calculus; students are recommended to familiarize themselves with all these mathematical techniques.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>PFA.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Textbooks and References</p>\n\n<p>1.

We will end with the fragmentation of the Mughal Empire and the rise of regional states in the eighteenth century. Within this time-frame, we will explore the rise and fall of sultanates and kingdoms, the dynamics of commercial production and mercantile traffic, the workings of kingly power, the techniques of military engagements, and the nature of social hierarchies and oppression. We will also closely study the relationships between gender and politics, religion and society, language and power, art and statecraft, language and culture. We will look at sufis and merchants, rulers and slaves, princesses and labourers, horses and elephants.

The syllabus is designed to familiarize the students with select concepts and ethnographies of the discipline. We will discuss the sociology and anthropology of kinship, social stratification (caste, race, tribe), cities, migration, nationalism, and environment. Rather than treating these as independent concepts, we seek to show their inter-relation with other social phenomena. For example, how are notions of family and kinship intertwined with science and technology studies; what is the connection between migration and urban transformations, how does one critically study the relation between environment and tourism etc. By doing this, the course demonstrates how the sociological approach explores and finds relations and connections between people, places, and objects. The objective of this course is to develop students&rsquo; appreciation of concepts and categories and their evolution and innovation. This course will also demonstrate to students how theory, ethnography and critical thinking can be integrated. Course materials will include examples from India as well as other parts of the world, and will offer a representative overview and not exhaustive coverage of all topics and perspectives existing in the discipline.

Are there such things that are useful but that are not up for exchange? What kinds of debts are generated when gifts and commodities are exchanged? Does the clearing of a debt signal the end of a relationship? Is reciprocity a good thing after all? What happens when you refuse a gift? If being creditable is a respectable characteristic, why are creditors typically such villainous characters? Is being indebted a show of strength or sign of weakness? What goes into making a price? What does it really mean for a thing to be priceless? If time is indeed money, is money also in some way a form or measure of time?</p>\n\n<p>This course is an intensive introduction to the anthropology of exchange through the circulation of gifts and commodities across diverse times and places.

Homo sapiens is a social creature who universally builds enduring cooperative relations with fellows. While learning to become and remain a social being is a universal human process likely rooted in our evolutionary makeup, the categories and the frames through which humans relate to, socialize, and cooperate with fellow humans display great diversity across history and geography. Studying these diverse frames of relatedness and asking theoretical questions about what is constant across differences is the primary preoccupation of anthropology as a discipline. Marriage, family, and kinship, in particular, have proved to be near-universal frames, provoking generalizing theories to explain their prevalence and underlying logic. War, enmity, conflict, and rivalry, in the meanwhile, present an equally prevalent frame of relationship. Throughout this course, we will engage with key theories that inform anthropological inquiry on these diverse forms of cooperation and conflict.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/Kin Friends Enemies Course Details Can Evren_d7ae3284-5676-4576-a25c-34b25fc1f4ca.docx'>Kin Friends Enemies Course Details Can Evren_d7ae3284-5676-4576-a25c-34b25fc1f4ca.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

This course examines the historical origins and contemporary dynamics of ethnic politics in the developing world, with particular focus on the intersections of ethnicity, nationalism, and violence. Through a study of theoretical approaches, we will explore the impact of colonialism on ethnic identities, the legacy of decolonization on nationalist movements, and the challenges that multiethnic states face post-independence. Case studies will provide insight into the lived experiences behind these complex issues, from political strife in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to conflicts across Africa, and Asia.</p>\n\n<p>Students will engage with key debates in the field, addressing questions such as: To what extent is ethnic identity a driving factor in political violence, or is it simply a label assigned to contemporary conflicts? How can ethnic identity, if it is a causal factor, be integrated into predictive theories? What are the origins and constructions of ethnic identity, and how do they relate to nationalist movements? We will assess both theoretical and empirical studies to critically evaluate whether existing models adequately address these issues.</p>\n\n<p>Designed to equip students with critical analytical tools, this course aims to cultivate historical and theoretical perspectives on ethnic conflict.

Seeking answers to these questions, this course brings in dialogue the works of art with the spaces that such works have come to inhabit in our present world &ndash; museums, art galleries, and other spaces of visual exhibitions. Moving beyond the established trajectories of looking at exhibitions, museums, and gallery spaces as storehouses of masterpieces of Art, or merely as spaces of ordering, classifying, and displaying objects and images, we will look closely at how exhibition practices of museums and public art galleries, constitute the very category &ldquo;Art&rdquo; around a select body of objects and images. Beginning with early modern royal and notable private collections, and cabinet of curiosities across the world, the course will explore the specific moments of the coming into being of public museums and art galleries through fairs, &ldquo;freak shows&rdquo;, and world exhibitions in Europe and across different parts of the world. It will explore how politics of collection, museum acquisition, display, and repatriation are tied with larger questions of colonialism, war, loot, postcolonial nationalist reassertions, and postwar encounters with race and ethnicity. With a specific focus on Asia, the course will map the connected global trajectories of museums, art galleries and memorials as dense narratives of unfolding spatial and temporal complexes. In the process it will highlight the role of the artists, curators, and museum/ gallery visitors in the production of a complex set of dialogues around artistic, and curatorial visions. The course will end by looking at contemporary South Asia, mapping the challenges of redesigning exhibition orders of older museums and art institutions and spread of museum modes of display and viewing, with different intent, in commemorative sites, theme parks, memorials, and new temples. This co-constitution of art and art museums will be addressed during class discussions and during compulsory and graded off campus museums galleries, and site classes and&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash; to the Indian Museum, Kolkata (virtual), the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi (on site), the National Museum, New Delhi (on site,) the National Handloom and Handicrafts Musem, New Delhi, (on site), the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal, Nodia (on site), the Swaminarayan Akshardham&nbsp;Complex, New Delhi (on site),&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhai Mati Das Museum (on site),&nbsp; the British Museum, London (virtual) and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (virtual).</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>On successful completion of the course, we will be able to: a) Explore the main trends in the development of Art History, Visual Culture and Museum Studies by accessing the critical essential skills. b) Evaluate the approaches of artists, art historians, and curators to the field of visual arts and museum studies c) Explore curatorial practices in the art world d) Develop the interests for a future training in art curatorial programme and critical museum studies.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Modules</p>\n\n<p>Introduction to the Scope and Aims of the Course: Why Museums?

The assessment and grading criterion are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>1) Students will be assessed on basis on their active engagement with course contents during classes which will carry ten percent (10%) of the total course grades.</p>\n\n<p>2) Museum, Gallery and site visits and subsequent submission of one written report on spatial politics gallery display, curatorial visions, and visitor perceptions (within&nbsp;1000 to 1200 words) will carry thirty percent (30%) of the total course grades.</p>\n\n<p>3) The mid semester assessment will comprise of a class presentation based on any one site or gallery or an image in a museum chosen by the student in consultation with the instructor. The mid semester evaluation will carry twenty percent (20%) of the total course grades.</p>\n\n<p>4) For the end semester evaluation we will write an essay between 2000 and 2500 words (including footnotes and bibliography). The topic of the end semester assessment has to be chosen by the student from a range of verbal text and visual image prompts provided by the course instructor. The end semester assessments for this course will follow a feed forward method and students are actively encouraged to submit (within date and time specified) one working draft/ draft in progress to the course instructor for comments and feedback. The end semester assessment will carry forty percent (40%) of the total course grades.</p>\n\n<p>5) All submissions including field reports, mid semester and end semester papers have to be made electronically.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n6) Plagiarism (intended or unintended) constitutes the most serious academic offence. Any act of plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Integrity Committee of the University and will attract punitive measures from grade cuts to failing the course. Please go through the Academic Integrity document of Ashoka University to check what constitutes plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty. Specific citation styles for texts and images will be addressed by specific course instructors.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;7) Audit students have to give and actively participate in classes (both on campus and museum, gallery, and site classes). Students auditing the course have to present for the mid semester presentations. For end semester assessments, audit students have to submit 250-400 words abstracts of the end semester essay.

The concept of social exclusion as an analytical framework has become increasingly relevant for an understanding of the notions of environmental inequality, conflicts, rights and justice. The course will capture the social exclusion structures and processes which restrict the access of certain social groups to environmental resources and entitlements. It will explain the different forms of social disadvantage &ndash; in village and community, in land and water, in space and commons, in wilderness and conservation &ndash; that persist, in multiple variants and with different intensity, across societies and nations. It will locate the agency to groups that either guard their domain of privilege or challenge the system of social inequalities and segmentation. Thus, understanding social exclusion as a condition/outcome as well as a dynamic process, the course will also examine some environmental justice movements. The course will also be contextually and temporally embedded. In the north, for example, along with African-Americans, Latino and indigenous people, the focus has been the changing nature of social exclusion in environment. Accordingly, the relevant focus groups are the new social groups, including the immigrants and ethnic groups. By contrast, in the Indian context, the problem is one of the persistent, multiple exclusion of certain social groups like Dalit affecting their basic environmental access and rights.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course is organized around weekly lectures and discussions based on the readings.

This is to encourage Innovation and Independent thinking (30%).</li>\n</ul>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><h2><strong>Attention, Future Econ-Tech Wizards!</strong></h2>\n\n<p>You&#39;ve probably heard that showing up is half the battle, but in this class, it&#39;s more like the opening move in the great game of &quot;Becoming an Econ-Tech Wizard&rdquo;. Here&#39;s the scoop:</p>\n\n<h3>Attendance: Your Key to the Vault of Attentiveness!</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Attendance is your golden key to the vault of &quot;Attentiveness&quot; (which, by the way, is a whopping 20% of your grade!). But remember, merely unlocking the door isn&#39;t enough to claim the treasure; you&#39;ve got to be sharp, involved, and ready to crack the economic codes.</li>\n\t<li>Think of each class as a heist where we&#39;re stealing knowledge. Every session is a crucial step in planning our grand economic heist. Miss one, and you might miss the blueprint to the next big score in your project or assignment.</li>\n\t<li>The Thrilling Part: In every class, there&#39;s hidden &quot;Intel&quot; - these could be strategic insights, secret shortcuts in coding, or even surprise challenges that can amplify your &quot;Attentiveness&quot; score. You&#39;ll only get access to this intel if you&#39;re in the room, both in body and mind.</li>\n\t<li>The Catch: Skipping class is like missing the heist planning session - you might think you&#39;re still in the game, but you&#39;ve missed out on the crucial details and the thrill of the plot. Plus, you&#39;ll have to play catch-up solo, and trust me, the heist plan (a.k.a. lecture notes) isn&#39;t nearly as exciting without the live experience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, come for the attendance, stay for the heist. Let&#39;s pull off the greatest economic tech caper together, one masterfully enjoyed class at a time!</p>\n</div></div>",

Between slums and smart cities, they inhabit a world of social conflict, ecological crisis, and contending visions of the future. As cities become even more central to social experience and aspiration, we need to understand their place in history and in human imagination. This course looks at cities through three thematic lenses: accumulation, order, and identity. It studies cities in relation to the countryside, tracing flows of people and goods that create wealth and poverty. It examines the spatial politics of managing urban populations, from planning to securitisation. It analyses cities as places where cultural identities &ndash; parochial and progressive &ndash; are formed and defended. It uses these themes to illuminate the political ecology of cities in the Global South, particularly issues around land, water, waste, and climate change.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>See attached syllabus.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>1.&nbsp; Attendance and class participation (20%)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students must come to class prepared to discuss the assigned readings and participate actively in class discussions.</p>\n\n<p>You will be required to post one analytical question or comment (less than 100 words) by midnight before class each week (except Week 1).

So much so that one often wonders if and to what extent anthropology&nbsp;is&nbsp;method? This course explores the relationships between anthropology and ethnography and those between question and method in the making of the discipline. Indeed, in some ways, the course could also have been named Anthropology&#39;s Questions. Here are some other questions we will ask: What might it mean to have an anthropological imagination or an ethnographic sensibility? How are they related? Where does the field of fieldwork begin and end and how does one find it? What is the relationship between a &#39;site&#39; and &#39;sight&#39; in constituting the field? How else does one sense the field? How long does it take to arrive at and exist in the everyday and how does one exit? How does one deal with questions of subjects and objects, subjectivity and objectivity, intimacy and scale, the actual and the virtual, power and privilege, anonymity and representation, originality and authenticity? How does one go about uncovering and establishing relationships in practice? What is the role of comparison in anthropology? What does it mean to move relationally and comparatively in conceptual and empirical terms? What are the different ways in which anthropologists approach &#39;the field&#39; and &#39;the archive&#39;? How does one go about conducting fieldwork and composing an ethnography? What are disciplinary codes and conventions, how are they established, when are they broken? In what ways might the limitations of anthropology&#39;s methods expand our imagination of its very possibilities? &nbsp;Over the semester, this course will attempt to address these and other questions through close reading, discussion and debates on a range of anthropological texts and texts on anthropology and its methods. Students will also complete a series of methodological exercises and assignments, including crafting a short research proposal.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

Tracking the movement of each individual particle in these systems is neither feasible nor necessary. Interestingly, many properties of bulk matter are independent of the microscopic details. For example, heat flows naturally from hot to cold objects, and liquids boil more readily at lower pressures. What&rsquo;s remarkable is that we can accurately predict these behaviours without needing to know the exact characteristics of the individual particles. This is made possible by thermodynamics, which adopts a phenomenological approach. Rather than analysing the complexities of microscopic interactions, thermodynamics focuses on macroscopic quantities that can be measured directly. In this course, we will examine how the fundamental principles of thermal equilibrium arise from a few basic concepts, offering valuable insights into the behaviour of these systems.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Topics that this course will cover include, Basic concepts: Temperature and the Equation of State,&nbsp;&nbsp;First and second laws (work and internal energy; heat engine, Carnot theorem, Clausius theorem, entropy)&nbsp;thermodynamic potentials and methods (natural variables, Maxwell equations, chemical potential, fundamental relation), thermodynamics of phase transition, Kinetic theory of gases.</p>\n\n<p>Reference books:</p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp; Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics by F.

This course provides an opportunity to critically assess the stories that shaped our understanding of morals, culture, and values, as well as those we will impart to future generations. In this discussion-oriented interactive course, we will read and review children&rsquo;s books, examine the purposes of visual literacy, and write reviews on specific authors and illustrators. We will write our own children&rsquo;s book to gauge all that we have learnt.</p>\n\n<p>This course aims to examine how the books children read shape their outlook and emotional development. We will study the historical, creative, nurturing, emotional, and educational aspects of these forms of literature and their impact on us later in life. We will also consider why a study of children&rsquo;s literature is important, and how it impacts pedagogies for children across borders.</p>\n\n<p>We will examine the views of multiple theoretical thinkers and texts in conjunction with actual children&#39;s literature. We will ask the important but often overlooked questions about this particular genre, mainly focusing on Indian and Western children&rsquo;s literature. The purpose is not so much to compare these two cultural offerings, but to give us a taste of both.</p>\n\n<p>We shall consider popular stories for children up to 12 years old, including Harry Potter &amp; The Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone, Amar Chitra Katha, Matilda, The Little Prince, Feluda and Mulan. At the same time, we will also study theoretical thinkers such as Jack Zipes, Seth Lerer, Paulo Freire, and Bruno Bettelheim to help us navigate the complex field of children&rsquo;s literature in relation to issues of culture, religion, difference, gender, and sexuality.</p>\n\n<p>We will unpack the didactic intent as well as the pleasure principle that might have prompted the writers. Authorial intent is, however, only one part of our study; the other part is to see how children and parents receive these stories. Children&rsquo;s literature creates moral as well as national frameworks that help acculturate young people. In examining the genre of children&rsquo;s literature, we will consider various sub-genres such as picture books, fairy tales, fables, and chapter books.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>For all readings that are written in the syllabus on a particular date: you should have completed your reading before that day&rsquo;s class.<br />\nPlease note that supplementary readings may be assigned during the course of the semester.

In effect, you will learn to ask the &lsquo;why&rsquo; and &lsquo;how&rsquo; questions alongside the &lsquo;who&rsquo; and &lsquo;what&rsquo; queries you have been posing through your school education. You will engage with a variety of source materials and understand how to ask questions that extend and enrich your understanding&mdash;of situations, texts, institutions and people. You will explore the distinctness of academic research and writing, and participate in an active knowledge community constituted by your peers. By the close of the course, you will have a clearer understanding of what it means to be a scholar in an academic setting, and a keener sense of your own processes of learning, thinking and writing.</p>\n\n<p>The theme this semester for this particular ICT course will be &#39;Feminisms and Masculinities&#39; where we will read essays and extracts by Mukul Kesavan, Sanjay Srivastava, Rahul Roy, Joseph Campbell,&nbsp;Rebecca Solnit, Sharmila Rege, Meena Kandasamy, bell hooks, and others and explore whether there is one universal Feminism and one accepted Masculinity or is the world inhabited by multiple feminisms and several masculinities; we shall also try to look carefully for links between these multiple feminisms and varying masculinities. In exploring these questions, we will also look at a variety of popular cultural references: memes, short films, podcasts, and advertisements.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Reading:</p>\n\n<p>1.

The objective of this class is not to simply interpret individual poems (though this will form part of our activity). Instead we will try and determine the ways by which a satisfactory answer to such a question may be figured out at all. The task is one of figuring out a successful definition, and in this process we will devise methods to reliably identify and study the fundamental constituents of any poem. Two such constituents, for example, are language and mind, and so we will explore ideas in the philosophy of these objects to develop an acceptable answer to our question.</p>\n\n<p>As we progress you will learn and practice via exercises, some elementary aspects of logic (such as the meaning of an argument, paraphrasing to clarify and juudge and argument, and the way to describe abstract entities), and decide for yourself whether they are anywhere useful for questions about the nature and philosophy of art. Other fixed aspects of the course include discussions on the philosophy of scientific methods, the nature of human creativity and language; group discussions on the interpretation of poems; and, given this is a writing course, the composition of several essays in response to questions about ideas discussed in class.</p>\n\n<p>You will find that typical academic activities will have to follow naturally for you to develop an answer. These activities include navigating citations and bibliographies; organizing your thoughts by writing essays; and relying on peers for aid and discussion. In large part, however, the trajectory of the course will be decided by collective student effort and the progress made in developing an answer to the stated question. To this end, the syllabus remains flexible and secondary, and is only one means for our progress in discovery and learning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Given the nature of the endeavour and the direction this class typically takes, students interested in humanistic disciplines are encouraged to join but so are those who are interested in areas typically allied to the cognitive sciences (biology, computer science, linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, psychology). In any case there are no pre-requisites at all, so regardless of disciplinary leanings, anyone may join and productively engage.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Syllabus</p>\n\n<p>All texts will be provided to students either as print outs in class or as PDFs before class (uploaded to a shared drive). Modules on introductory logic will not be studied via texts. As mentioned above, this is a fairly flexible syllabus with guaranteed additions. But in one way or another, we will be touching on ideas from these following texts.</p>\n\n<p>Essays and Book excerpts:</p>\n\n<p>David Hume- &lsquo;Of the Standard of Taste&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>Immanuel Kant &ndash; &lsquo;What is Enlightenment&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>John Dewey&mdash;Art as Experience</p>\n\n<p>Karl Marx &ndash; &lsquo;Theses on Feuerbach&rsquo;/ The German Ideology</p>\n\n<p>Noam Chomsky&mdash;What Kind of Creatures Are We?</p>\n\n<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge&mdash;Notes on Shakespeare/Biographia Literaria</p>\n\n<p>Viktor Shklovsky&mdash;&#39;Art as Device&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>Wilhelm Von Humboldt&mdash;Limits of State Action</p>\n\n<p>William Wordsworth- &lsquo;Preface to the Lyrical Ballads&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>It will be necessary for students to read some of this material before class. However, in some cases discussions in class should suffice if one cannot read the texts.</p>\n\n<p>Poems:</p>\n\n<p>Mostly selections from Lyrical Ballads, and other English poetry. Since the endeavour of this class is a general explanation of poetry, students are free to suggest poems for everyone to read.</p>\n\n<p>Novel:</p>\n\n<p>Mary Shelley&mdash;Frankenstein. Students will have to review this novel for their mid term assignment.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The ICT will be graded on a number of elements. Your final assessment will account for your participation and performance in writing and non-writing components, and in formative work (building towards a bigger piece, or continuing a specific &lsquo;habit&rsquo;) and summative work (producing a final output).&nbsp;The components are below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1. Participation (in classes, meetings and peer work)</p>\n\n<p>2. Regular Assignments&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3. Group Discussion&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>4. A mid-term assignment of 800-1200 words.</p>\n\n<p>5. An end-term Academic essay of 2500 words</p>\n\n<p>A standard Ashoka rubric will be used in your eventual ICT grade, wherein the highest possible grade is &lsquo;A&rsquo; and the lowest possible grade is &lsquo;F&rsquo;.In general, grades in the &lsquo;A&rsquo; range demonstrate that you have consistently exceeded the expectations of the course; grades in the &lsquo;B&rsquo; range indicate that you have met the expectations for the course; grades in the &lsquo;C&rsquo; range and below, demonstrate that you have fallen short of the expectations for this course.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Typically I do not take attendance. However, you will have peer tutors assigned for this course. Missing more than two sessions with them will cause a 5 mark penalty.</p>\n</div></div>",

Here, we will look at art objects and take note of the various &quot;ways of seeing&quot; even as we try to understand the limits of the suppossed &quot;infinite variety&quot; of &quot;seeing&quot;. We will see how canons form and how they are and dismantled. We will attempt to think critically, always&nbsp;in the context of a looming climate crisis,&nbsp;about the stories we have begun to tell ourselves of late.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Introduction to Critical Thinking offers you different pathways to develop your habits of thinking and communication through reading, writing and research. It considers these as essential habits that can be strengthened through repetition.

It considers these as essential habits that can be strengthened through repetition. This course will aim to do so by closely examining the idea of culture &ndash; this pervasive, amorphous, contested and cherished thing &ndash; through an examination of food, films and urban spaces. The course will be broken into modules, each focusing on a set of cultural lenses that we will learn to apply to these topics.</p>\n\n<p>By the close of the course, you will have a keener sense of your own challenges and strengths as a writer and student, and a more robust sense of what it means to belong to a knowledge community constituted by your peers</p>\n\n<p>One of the key objectives of an ICT course is to develop with a critical mind the habits of writing, reading and the practices and ethics of research for undergraduate students. This course conceives of a number of these habits as formed through community-based engagement, which foregrounds aesthetic experiences as a collective activity. There will be a lot of group viewings when we get to our module on cinema, as well as a eld trip later in the semester.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the course, you will have a keener sense of your own processes of learning, thinking and writing, and a more robust sense of what it means to be &lsquo;scholar&rsquo; in an active knowledge community constituted by your peers.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Reading</p>\n\n<p>1.

Then we will review the ideas of four crucial 20th century figures: Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend, and Imre Lakatos.

In the scientific method, we look for internal and external inconsistencies in our models, ensuring that our beliefs are coherent within themselves (internal) and with available data (external). Health is an extremely important subject, relevant to each one of us individually and as a society, but is far more subjective than say physics or maths, where we can speak of fundamental laws of the universe that exist independent of us. Principles of health science teach us about the scientific method, but also about ourselves as a species and society, going beyond the natural sciences.&nbsp;Even used in the restricted context of human health, the meaning changes from birth to death, from past to present, and even from culture to culture. This course provides a view of sccientific thinking in health from multiple lenses, including physiology, digital technology, medical history, and sociology. I hope that this will serve as a model of how to scientifically analyze &lsquo;wicked&rsquo; interdisciplinary topics where neither the questions, nor the answers, are well-defined. We will cover the following topics in the context of health:</p>\n\n<p>a) The four paradigms of science: theoretical, experimental, computational simulation driven by theory and experiment, and &nbsp;lastly discovery from big observational data.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, at different stages of human history, how would we differently think about risk of tuberculosis.</p>\n\n<p>b) The disruptive effect of&nbsp;technologies.&nbsp;For example, how did germ theory&nbsp;and microscopes change the field of infectious diseases and public health</p>\n\n<p>c) How to ask a good scientific question.&nbsp;For example, what are the many questions inside &quot;How do we eradicate tuberculosis&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>d) Last, but not least, we will talk about how to go about finding an answer for a well stated question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A sub-theme in this course will be the future of health in a digital age, where the fourth paradigm is starting to become operational, disruptive technologies like GenAI are present, but we need to do better in terms of asking the right questions and working across disciplines to answer them.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning how to think scientifically and ask questions, and&nbsp;in the process&nbsp;learn the value of scientific thinking about health, towards better health</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Pre-requisites: None.</p>\n\n<p>Books and online resources:</p>\n\n<p>Youtube has many excellent resources on scientific method, including a lecture clip by Feynman (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYPapE-3FRw) and at Bozeman Science (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKGtkzgKfkc).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>No specific books are required but a free online book format resource is here - &nbsp;Introduction to History and Philosophy of Science by Hakob Barseghyan, Nicholas Overgaard, and Gregory Rupik (http://hakobsandbox.openetext.utoronto.ca)</p>\n\n<p>Some suggestions are below for those generally&nbsp;interested in health science and stories of discovery.</p>\n\n<p>1.

Our course will consider how fictional works from around the world and across time mirror real world complexities: growing-up, falling in love, being happy, having sex, being faithful, losing a friend, losing a way of life&nbsp;and&nbsp;facing death. We will learn to think about books as dreams, understanding how stories change via the shifting question &ldquo;Whose dream is it?&rdquo;.&nbsp; Over the semester we will entertain the idea that fictional characters and books mirror crucial real world-viewpoints, that books mirror each other, and that if a literary work can mirror the reality of living in the world, then perhaps our lives are more fictional than we think.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>1.

But can storytelling bring about revolutions? Is it possible for stories to stand up against colonial abuse, fight prejudices, bring social change, impact public policy? In this course, we will talk about stories that did exactly that and did it so spectacularly that generations have remained in awe of them. We will read novels, short stories, memoirs and essays to discover that each of these works of art were responsible for protesting against the injustices of their times. And in doing so, they highlighted and gave voice to the wrongs and discriminations of today. At the heart of each of these stories, we will encounter a fierce rejection of dogma and a stubborn insistence to speak out.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

What does it mean to love and care for oneself and for others? What allows us to love and care? What prevents us from caring and loving ourselves and others? What forces&mdash;personal, interpersonal, or collective and communal&mdash;regulate, prescribe and even prohibit experiences and expressions of love. As the narrator in Arundhati Roy&rsquo;s The God of Small Things poignantly reflects, such questions are older than any conception we might have of &ldquo;history,&rdquo; and comprise at times unspoken and often unwritten &ldquo;Love Laws&rdquo; that determine who can be loved, how and how much.</p>\n\n<p>Our primary goal in the course is to work towards developing a critical and comprehensive language around understanding care and love as the basis for any and all configurations of relationalities that both make and unmake our senses of being in the world. Beginning our journey with selections from <em>The Symposium</em> by Plato, verses from the <em>Gatha Sattasai</em>, and poetry from the Akam repertoire of Sangam literature, we will make our way through more contemporary iterations and meditations on caring and loving such as, Roland Barthes&rsquo; <em>A Lover&rsquo;s Discourse</em> and Ocean Vuong&rsquo;s <em>On Earth We Are Briefly Gorgeous</em>. All along the way we will be reflecting on and attempting to problematize &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;normative&rdquo; structures within which care and love are usually understood and experienced.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><u><strong>This is a tentative Assessment Rubric:</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><strong>#CareandLove #ALoveLikeThat: 20 points</strong></p>\n\n<p>Over the course of the semester, you will be sharing a total of 10 posts on a Social Media platform of your choosing. These posts must be shared the aforementioned hashtag(s). You will be compiling screenshots of these posts in a single word document. Each post must be consecutive over the weeks of the semester, show a clear time-stamp and be followed by a 2-3 sentence blurb.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Short Reflections: 10 points</strong></p>\n\n<p>You will be writing 2 short reflections of 150-200 words each. These will be based on the readings and our conversations in class and in the Discussion Sessions and will emphasize your experience of reading the texts being discussed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Midterm Essay: 10 points</strong></p>\n\n<p>You will be writing a 500-750-word essay (2-3 double-spaced pages). The topic/prompt will be discussed in class ahead of time. The midterm will then be peer reviewed and workshopped to be expanded into your final essay for the course.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Essay: 20 points</strong></p>\n\n<p>The final essay will be a 1250-1500-word essay (5-6 double-spaced pages), and will be a revised and enlarged version of the midterm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Symposium: 20 Points</strong></p>\n\n<p>You will be required to participate in a Symposium styled loosely after the one Plato narrates in his text, the theme for which will be &ldquo;A Love Like That&rdquo;.

As stated in the previous section of this syllabus, attendance and active participation in class are crucial to your success in this course. To such an end up to a total of 20% of your final grade will be based on your presence in and contributions to our conversations in class.

In this Great Books course, we will get acquainted with some of these satirical animals. We will encounter them as symbols, moral agents, political figures, and detached narrators. This course will, in keeping with the ethos of Foundations courses, familiarize students with methods from the different disciplines of philosophy, history, and literature: we will learn to read closely and critically, identify and respond to arguments, appropriately situate a work in its socio-historical context, and compare texts and ideas from different moments in time and space. By investigating how animals have been portrayed in fables, allegories, and novels, you will gain a deeper understanding of the power of satire in challenging conventions and provoking thought on human nature and society. And, hopefully, it goes without saying, we will also laugh &mdash; sometimes until we&rsquo;re in tears.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>A rough but representative list of readings (to be modified) is as follows [we won&#39;t read all of these but readings will be taken from this list]:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Unit 1: Moral animals</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Jataka Tales (selections)&nbsp;: Bherivāda Jataka, Baka Jataka, Kukkurajātaka</li>\n\t<li>Aesop&rsquo;s Fables (selections)</li>\n\t<li>The Golden Ass (Books X and XI) [2nd century CE], Apuleius</li>\n\t<li>A Mirror of Fools (1180 CE), Nigel de Longchamps</li>\n\t<li>The Nun&rsquo;s Priest&rsquo;s Tale [1390], Geoffrey Chaucer</li>\n\t<li>War of the Cat and the Mice (Katomyomachia) (14th century CE), Theodore Prodomos</li>\n\t<li>An Entertaining Tale of Quadrupeds and Book of Fish (Opsarologos) (14th century CE) , Unknown Byzantine author/s</li>\n\t<li>Fable of the Bees (1714), Bernard Mandeville</li>\n\t<li>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels: Voyage to the Land of the Houyhnhnms (1726), Jonathan Swift</li>\n\t<li>Poonachi (2018), Perumal Murugan</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Unit 2: Political animals</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Selections from : The Fables of Kalila and Dimna (Kalīla wa-Dimna)[13th century CE], Jataka tales [300 BCE - 400 CE], Panchatantra [300-500 CE]</li>\n\t<li>The Birds [414 BCE], Aristophanes</li>\n\t<li>The Assemblies of al-Hamadhani (Maqamat al-Hamadhani) [9th century CE], Badi&#39; al-Zaman al-Hamadani, selected tales</li>\n\t<li>The Story of Reynard the Fox (Le Roman de Renart) [12th century CE], selected tales</li>\n\t<li>Conference of the Birds (Mantiq al-Tayr) [12th century CE], Farid ud-Din Attar</li>\n\t<li>The Fatal Eggs [1924], Mikhail Bulgakov</li>\n\t<li>Animal Farm [1945], George Orwell</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Unit 3: Animal narrators</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Parrot (selections) [1746], Eliza Haywood</li>\n\t<li>The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr [1855], E.T.A.

Imagine you&rsquo;re writing for someone time-traveling to ancient Rome or medieval India, for example. What are some key facts you think they&rsquo;ll need to know to orient themselves? You can get as creative with the format as you&rsquo;d like. You can do this for any of the periods/cultures we&rsquo;re covering, but please sign up by the second week of classes to avoid clustering. The assignment will be due by 5pm on the Monday of the week we&rsquo;re covering that period/culture for the first time.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>In-class exam: 20%</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>There will be one in-class exams requiring you to use methods introduced in the lectures.

You can create any work of satire &ndash;&nbsp;a poem, a play, a cartoon, a painting, a podcast, a film, etc. You will be assessed not on the quality of your creative output, however, but on an accompanying essay where you explain and analyze your project as a work of satire.

Are our social interactions forms of playacting? How about the ways in which we present ourselves&mdash;as gendered bodies, as students, as friends, as professors, and as so many other less nameable identities&mdash;are these too performances? What would it tell us if we were to think of everyday social interaction and self-presentation as performance? Does this mean our interactions are shallow, our relationships fake, and our personalities mere pretense? Or will it reveal aspects of everyday life that otherwise remain hidden in plain view? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These are some questions that inspire this course to explore the social phenomenon of performance and its theoretical value to the humanities. We will investigate the ways in which our everyday behaviours and the stories we tell shape our identities and our experience of the world. We will see how thinking&nbsp;of,&nbsp;with, and&nbsp;through&nbsp;performance can help us investigate social behaviour, individual and collective identity, and embodied knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will do so by focusing on three recurring themes: first, the relationship between representation and performance, which will help us understand social behaviour; second, the paradigm of performativity, which is significant to theorizing identity; and third, the debate between whether performance is an ephemeral or enduring phenomenon, which is central to conceptualizing embodied knowledges. We will see, in short, how performance&mdash;as object, method, and analytic&mdash;can help us understand societies and cultures by focusing on acts of doing, ways of being, and modes of knowing. We will read Judith Butler, JL Austin, Diana Taylor, Richard Schechner, Susan Sontag, Harry Elam, Victor Turner, Bishnupriya Dutt, Erving Goffman, Clifford Geertz, Aparna Dharwadker, Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o, and Paulla Ebron. We will also engage with Dharamvir Bharati&rsquo;s&nbsp;Andha Yug, Maya Rao&rsquo;s&nbsp;Walk, and the real-life cases of Rachel Dolezal and Jessica Krug.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(Undergrads may sign up for&nbsp;ENG-2610 or PA-2610, while grads are welcome to sign up for ENG-4610.)&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Grading Rubric</p>\n\n<p>Class participation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20% &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Entry and exit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10%</p>\n\n<p>Roundtable spokesperson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10%</p>\n\n<p>Roundtable scribe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10%</p>\n\n<p>Response Posts (10% x 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30%</p>\n\n<p>Group Projects &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div>",

So first, we will lead up to the real numbers naturally,while seeing<br />\nthe integers and rational numbers along the way.<br />\nHaving reached the real numbers, we will then explore how calculus helps<br />\nus understand the notion of infinity. This will be done by defining sequences<br />\nand series, which provide a standard mechanism to deal with infinitely many<br />\nquantities.<br />\nWe will then move to functions on real numbers, which are the fundamental<br />\nobjects on which calculus is performed. We will try to understand functions<br />\nfrom a graphical point of view as well, by seeing how to draw/sketch graphs of<br />\nfunctions.<br />\nThen, we come to the notion of limits and continuous functions, which are<br />\nvery natural examples of functions that can be studied under the umbrella of<br />\ncalculus.<br />\nThen, we come to one of the fundamental operations of calculus : the dif-<br />\nferentiation operation. We define differentiable functions, and then look at the<br />\nadvantage of how differentiation helps constrain functions : this would include<br />\ne.g. the mean value theorem and the famous L&rsquo;Hopital&rsquo;s rule for limits of ratios<br />\nof functions.<br />\nThen, we look at generalizations of the mean value theorem, which are the<br />\nTaylor and Maclaurin series.<br />\nHaving studied differentiation in detail, we now move to integration, defining<br />\ncarefully the theory of Riemann integration. We then study various definite and<br />\nindefinite integrals, understanding along the way techniques to solve them.<br />\nFinally, the fundamental theorem of calculus completes the discussion. The<br />\nrest of the course focuses on the applications of calculus : this includes optimiza-<br />\ntion by setting the derivative to zero, and applications of calculus to mechanics.<br />\nAs references, we will use</p>\n\n<p><br />\n1.

The course will begin with giving an understanding of the ecological processes underlying extinction and ecosystem degradation as well as its consequences for society. The historical and political dimensions of species loss/extinction will also be discussed. The course will then turn to critically exploring past and prevalent paradigms and strategies for biodiversity conservation such as strict nature protection, Integrated Conservation and Development (ICDP), community-based conservation, crop certification, Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) and ecotourism,&nbsp; with the aid of key international case studies. In addition, current debates on Indian wildlife laws and policies will be discussed using case studies. The aim of this course is to use perspectives from a variety of disciplines, including ecology, history, political science, economics and sociology, to develop a holistic view of today&rsquo;s biodiversity crisis and its solutions. Students will be taken on a field trip to Mandothi wetlands, Haryana where they will apply their course learning to the issue of wetland conservation in production landscapes.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The students will learn to integrate knowledge from different disciplinary areas and sources (scholarly literature, audio-visual resources and traditional knowledge systems)&nbsp;to understand real-life biodiversity conservation in terms of science, policy and on-ground implementation. They will also learn to critically analyze policy documents related to conservation and write well-referenced commentaries on various topics. Students will learn how to&nbsp;engage in productive class debates based on the readings and documentaries that they are assigned.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>List of Topics/Modules</strong></p>\n\n<p>Modules 1,2,3: Causes of Biodiversity Loss</p>\n\n<p>This module will discuss the causes of biodiversity loss, specifically, habitat loss, land-use change, habitat fragmentation, invasives, climate change, pollution and overkill (hunting). Students will discuss varying perspectives on the primary causes of biodiversity loss, through juxtaposing arguments from Gold (2003), Tal (2018) and Barnard and Emmanuel (2014).</p>\n\n<p>Module 4,5,6: Strictly Protected Areas: History and Management</p>\n\n<p>The concept of strictly protected areas (SPA) is discussed. SPAs are an important manifestation of the exclusionary mode of conservation as practised globally. Due to the way they are designed and implemented, they have led to widespread alienation of local residents due to displacement, curtailment of access to natural resources and human-wildlife conflict. At the same time, they have proven useful in being able to save species from extinction. However, poor application of science, financial shortages, poor governance and administration, and lack of specific management objectives have led to a situation where in many cases ecosystem degradation is as high inside PAs as outside. In this module we explore the history, management and effectiveness of PAs with an emphasis on the importance of ecosystem management for preserving biodiversity.</p>\n\n<p>Module 7,8: Exploring Policies on Conservation-Induced Displacement</p>\n\n<p>Displacement of local residents has been a way to create inviolate spaces for protected areas across the world, with implications for environmental justice. In this module, we explore the specific policies for conservation-induced displacement from Tiger Reserves in India, with reference to the law and the implementation processes.</p>\n\n<p>Module 9,10: Human-Wildlife Conflicts</p>\n\n<p>This module explores the many dimensions of human-wildlife conflict- that is responsible for considerable damage to human lives and livelihoods in developing countries. Wild animals damage crops, kill livestock and injure and kill humans, many of whom already belong to marginalised sections of society. The behavioural, historical, ecological and political factors that determine extent and intensity of conflict are discussed, as well as the consequences for human-animal relations. Mitigative strategies including insurance and compensatory schemes, creation of corridors and village relocation are also discussed through a case study on elephant-human conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Module 11,12: Institutions and Institutional Weakness</p>\n\n<p>Forest institutions are key to effective long-term conservation, yet there is little understanding of their structure and functioning in developing countries. In India, forest institutions bear the historical burden of exclusionary management established by the colonial administration, whose legacy influences us to the present day. Students will read a set of key papers examining this aspect of wildlife conservation. They will also watch the movie Sherni (2021) to delve deeply into the issues facing forest institutions in India and elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Module &nbsp;13,14</p>\n\n<p>The Integrated Conservation &amp; Development (ICDP) Model</p>\n\n<p>The Integrated Conservation &amp; Development (ICDP) Model came about as a reaction to the dominant exclusionary mode of conservation practices in most developing countries. It aims to reduce the adverse impact of PA on people&rsquo;s livelihoods while at the same time, reducing the anthropogenic impact on nature.&nbsp; To what extent can this win-win situation be realised? Is ICDP basically an inherently flawed model or are there conditions and circumstances under which ICDP can be successful in a developing economy? These are some of the questions being explored in this module.</p>\n\n<p>Module 16: Field Trip</p>\n\n<p>Students will be taken on a field trip to Mandothi village and wetlands, Jhajjar District, Haryana. Students will apply their learnings from the course to explore the modalities and complexities of wildlife conservation in the larger landscape comprising human settlements and agriculture. There will be a guided class discussion based on the field trip and the assigned readings.</p>\n\n<p>Module 17,18: Community-Based Conservation</p>\n\n<p>The view that wild areas largely managed by indigenous communities and local residents, lately named community conserved areas or CCAs, can be effective in saving species and ecosystems from extinction, is rapidly gaining ground. Yet several scholars have pointed out that local management can result in unsustainable use which detracts from conservation. Varying perspectives on the usefulness and effectiveness of CCAs on different continents will be discussed in this module.</p>\n\n<p>Module 19,20: Conservation outside Protected Areas: Cities, Fields and Fallows</p>\n\n<p>In this module, we discuss the possibilities of biological conservation in landscapes devoted to production, particularly, agriculture. Trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and agricultural production have become increasingly visible. Traditional means of agriculture that focus on subsistence actually encourage biodiversity over large scales; increasing intensification can lead to local elimination of a range of species. In a world where food production is being prioritized, it is necessary to understand these trade-offs and the production systems that may allow for coexistence with wild species. In this context, global &lsquo;land-sharing&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;land-sparing&rsquo; strategies will be discussed. Students will be introduced to urban ecology which is another important area of conservation, given the large-scale transition from rural to urban settlement during the last few decades.</p>\n\n<p>Modules 21,22: Economic Incentives for Conservation</p>\n\n<p>Several ways to induce conservation-oriented behaviour based on financial benefits have been experimented with during the last few decades such as debt-for-nature swaps, direct payments, payments for environmental services, timber certification and conservation easements. Payment for Environmental Services (PES) has recently emerged as an important financial tool for encouraging biodiversity conservation. In these modules, PES is examined from the ecological, political and historical perspectives and evaluated as a conservation tool in developing countries, using Costa Rica as a case study. We will also discuss the effectiveness, constraints and potential of ecotourism as a conservation tool, based on examples from South America and India.</p>\n\n<p>Module 23: Invasives and human well-being</p>\n\n<p>(Guest Lecture by Dr. Ankila Hiremath, ATREE)</p>\n\n<p>Module 24: Ecosystem Restoration: Ecology and Politics</p>\n\n<p>Students will be exposed to two restoration examples- one of a grassland in Maharashtra, and one of a scrub forest in Haryana through video recordings. These examples will demonstrate the social-ecological complexities of ecosystem restoration. Based on these examples, they will debate viable means of restoration.</p>\n\n<p>Module 25,26: Case Study on Wetland conservation</p>\n\n<p>Wetlands are one of the most widespread and biodiverse ecosystems worldwide, ranging from rivers that can be seen as the fount of civilization, and human-made lakes created for everyday use. &nbsp;Yet they are poorly understood in terms of ecology and human use, and subject to misuse, pollution and misgovernance. Further, rural and urban communities who are dependent on these ecosystems have been as marginalised as the ecosystems themselves largely due to the process of urbanization. In this module, the complex social ecology of wetlands will be explored. In this session, we will revisit many of the issues emerging out of the earlier field trip to Mandothi wetland. Students, through break-out sessions, will be asked to debate the policy changes that are required for long-term conservation of wetlands that can imbibe both social and ecological values, based on the field trip, a documentary and course readings.</p>\n\n<p>The successful completion of this course will depend upon intensive reading, timely completion of assignments and tests, in-class student presentations and participation in discussions. Students should show in-depth engagement with readings and lectures. 40-50 pages of reading will be assigned each week.&nbsp; &nbsp;Students will be evaluated on the basis of one essay assignment, a mid-term test and a final term paper in this course. In addition, students will be graded on their attendance, class presentations and participation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The specific weightage of marks in this course will be as follows:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Class presentations (and participation in discussions): 20%</p>\n\n<p>Short Essay Assignment: 25%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mid-term Test (In-class): 25%</p>\n\n<p>Final Term Paper : 25 %</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Grading rubric with equivalent % and Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>A&gt;=90%Excellent on all counts.

Since this concern links two concept groups, this course doubles as a stylized and brief introduction to the literature on foreign aid and democratization. In democratization (Part I), we will consider the type of foreign interventions, the drivers of democratization, the special role of elections and the varieties of authoritarianism. In Foreign aid (Part II), we will cover the types of foreign aid, the efficacy debate, the modalities of democracy aid, the incentive of aid donors and recipients and donor switching.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After the theoretical overview, we consider a practical approach to existing political constraints (Part III), as articulated in my book, Liberalization at the Margins. We skim the empirics and put more emphasis on the case studies of the aid-democratization dynamic for Egypt, Fiji, and Myanmar. We conclude by considering the policy implications of such strategies with an emphasis on the authoritarian backlash (and authoritarian strategies for international law.)</p>\n\n<p>This course is dual listed under both International Relations (IR) and&nbsp;Political Science (PS).</p>\n\n<p>The attached syllabus is a older draft.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Through the course, students should be able to 1) identify the major issues and debates in foreign aid, 2) analyse the costs and benefits of various modalities of democracy aid, and 3) consider the policy implications of democracy promotion.

Before the mid-term, we will read from the foundations of psychoanalysis in the four oldest schools: Freudian, Kleinian, British Middle-school and Lacanian.&nbsp; After the mid-term we will read contemporary psychoanalytic writing on the themes of mourning, violence, colonization and sexual perversity. &nbsp;As we absorb the language of psychoanalysis and learn to translate back and forth between psychoanalytic and literary registers, we will keep thinking about what makes psychoanalytic writing psychoanalytic.&nbsp; One of these features, our course argues, is that the status of the relationship between the imaginary and the real is never quite settled: &nbsp;sometimes on the side of control and other times in support of the wildness of the imagination, psychoanalysis constantly argues with itself about how radical it wants to be.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Class Participation (20%) Our course is reading intensive and depends on your classroom engagement.

While it is well-established that male bodies make up the vast majority of decision-makers and participants in quotidian electoral politics, the same logic applies to contexts affected by conflict and war. Conventionally, male bodies are considered to be at the forefront of decision-making about whether to go to war, and on the frontlines of said wars as fighters.</p>\n\n<p>In the last few decades, however, these constructions of masculinity and femininity have come to be questioned. Instead, the understanding that gender affects the way in which we see and make sense of the world around us &ndash;&nbsp;and that men and women experience and affect wartime and electoral dynamics differently &ndash; has come front and center. In the same spirit, we will focus on the role of women in political decision-making and participation; their role both as perpetrators of violence as combatants (and terrorists), as victims and as survivors of male-victimizing atrocities; the militarization of gendered bodies and the impact of gender-based violence in armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will reflect on the gendered aspects of women&rsquo;s restructuring of economies in male absence, their resistance to political violence, and their role in peacekeeping and rebuilding societies after war. As we cover each theme, we will pay particular attention to what feminists have described as intersectionality and the continuum of violence, from the &ldquo;private&rdquo; to the &ldquo;public&rdquo; sphere, from the militarization of everyday living to overt violent conflict. In addition, we will pay attention to whether different approaches to tackling gender inequality in South Asian contexts have been effective.</p>\n\n<p>Assignments for the course include submissions that identify, assess, and integrate arguments based on the week&rsquo;s readings; an in-class midterm assignment; in class pop quizzes; and a final paper. Additionally, students will be assessed on their preparation for the week&rsquo;s class through attendance, participation and in-class presentations.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

In contemporary imaginations, mountains are essential for the planet&rsquo;s survival and indeed our own physical and mental health. But this was not always the case. In pre-modern Europe, for example, mountains were either ignored or depicted in literature as ugly deformities that scarred the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Why did Europeans think of mountains as ugly? How, when, and why did their aesthetic imaginations change to a point where someone like the celebrated polymath John Ruskin could write that &ldquo;mountains are the beginning and the end of all scenery&rdquo;? How did European perceptions of mountains differ from that of the peoples and traditions of South Asia and elsewhere? And what role has South Asian history played in shaping modern human relationships with the mountains?</p>\n\n<p>This course will take students on a journey from early Asia and pre- modern Europe, to the eighteenth-century when the Alps emerged as objects of adventure, veneration, and scientific experimentation, which in turn, kickstarted two new modern practices&mdash; mountain tourism and the world&rsquo;s most literary sport, mountaineering. This course will then explore how these practices were deeply imbricated with colonialism, nationalism, fascism, and masculinity in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. The course will end in the late twentieth century where it will focus on commercialization of mountaineering and on issues pertaining to non-European modernity. In other words, this course will take students on a journey from a stage in human history where mountains were at best the abode of gods and spirits, and, at worst, ugly deformities, to a stage where there are now &ldquo;traffic jams&rdquo; on Mount Everest.</p>\n\n<p>Focused on the Alps and the Himalaya, this interdisciplinary course will offer a new and exciting vantage point for learning about several fundamental issues and concepts in history and the humanities. Students will learn how scholars in the humanities have rehabilitated mountains as a key terrain where modernity is performed, its limits are exposed, and occasionally transcended. They will also learn about the extent to which our knowledge of the world is framed from the perspective of those who live in the &ldquo;lowlands.&rdquo; Overall, this course will motivate students to think of the history of human interactions with mountains as vital for making sense of what it means to be modern, and, for understanding how we got there.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Tenative Course Syllabus</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><u><strong>Module I: A Cultural History of Mountains</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><u>Week 1: Mountains in Pre-Modern European Imagination and World History</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of the Aesthetics of the Infinite,</em> pp. 34-71.</p>\n\n<p>James Scott <em>The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland South Asia</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 127-177.</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 2: Mountains in Pre-modern India</u></p>\n\n<p>Kalidasa, <em>Meghaduta</em> excerpts</p>\n\n<p>Kalidasa, <em>Kumarasambhava</em>, excerpts</p>\n\n<p>Nachiket Chanchani <em>Mountain Temples and Temple Mountains: Architecture, Religion and Nature in Central Himalaya</em>, pp. 25-74.</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 3: Scared Mountain in Early to Middle China</u></p>\n\n<p>Wei- Cheng Lin, <em>Building A Sacred Mountain: The Buddhist Architecture of China&rsquo;s Mount Wutai</em>, pp. 51-88.</p>\n\n<p>Wen-shing Chou <em>Mount Wutai Vision of a Sacred Buddhist Mountain</em>, excerpts</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 4: Environment and Aesthetics in Modern Europe</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of The Aesthetics of the Infinite</em> pp. 324-369.</p>\n\n<p>Allen Carlson <em>Nature and Landscape: An Introduction to Environmental Aesthetics,</em> chapter 1, pp. 1-37.</p>\n\n<p>Jon Mathieu, &ldquo;The Sacralization of Mountains in Europe during the Modern Age&rdquo; <em>Mountain Research and Development</em>, 26 (4), pp. 343-349</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 5: Three interpretations of Change in European Attitudes towards the Mountains</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of The Aesthetics of the Infinite </em>pp. 271-323.</p>\n\n<p>Peter Hansen <em>The Summits of the Modern Man: Mountaineering After Enlightenment</em> pp. 30-60.</p>\n\n<p>B.

What is the relevance of drawing, today?<br />\nThis course examines the intersections between drawing and text, drawing and painting, drawing and photography, drawing and video, drawing and performance, and drawing and popular culture. In thinking of the everyday through the prism of theatrical reality, the course encourages inquiry about how drawings and the act of drawing itself is a dialogue about provisionality, uncertainty, and change. How do artists and artistic explorations address issues of meaning-making and shared history, politics, and culture? How do repetition, layering, overlapping, erasure, and incision transform an image, leading to alternative perspectives about how we perceive and engage with the known? How can we tell the same story in different material and socio-cultural contexts? Recognizing the importance of contradictions, ambiguity, and serendipity as integral to meaning-making processes, students have the flexibility to make interventions that can vary from poetic, polemic, dramatic, metaphorical, provocative, or incisive.

We will thus examine different contexts of &ldquo;refugee- making&rdquo; including situations of ethnic strife and civil war in different locations around the world. We will then attempt to contextualize how these situations, in Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, formed important precedents in the shaping of the international understanding of the extent to which rights ought to be accorded to stateless populations.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, we will show, the necessity of the modern state to impose control and regulation over travel and migration across modern borders, produced an international regime that understood human populations as the recipients of differentiated rights according to nationality. Yet, as the experiences of different communities of migrants, refugees and stateless populations also testify, the urge to classify communities as &lsquo;migrants&rsquo; or &lsquo;aliens&rsquo; is a relatively recent intervention and attempts by modern states to regulate and control the timeless habit of human travel do not always produce successful results.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Grading:</p>\n\n<p>Mid Term Assignment: 30%</p>\n\n<p>End Term Assignment: 30%</p>\n\n<p>Quiz: 15%</p>\n\n<p>In Class Presentation* : 15%</p>\n\n<p>Attendance, class participation and attendance in seminars: 10%</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>More than 3 excused absences will lead to grade cuts in the mid term and final assignments.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/Refugees Migrants and Citizens_ddde8cfb-b22e-4fd6-ba69-745e52907771.docx'>Refugees Migrants and Citizens_ddde8cfb-b22e-4fd6-ba69-745e52907771.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

The aim is to free pedagogy, reading, and creative-critical interaction with both Indian and European texts from the interpretative parameters of &nbsp;&#39;Western modernity&#39;, while also rejecting categories like &#39;non-Western modernity&#39; that serve a merely corrective purpose. Instead, I wish to enquire afresh into the journey of literary and artistic modernity, using writing from India as my starting-point. I also plan to bring in some material from outside India &ndash; the stories of Junichiro Tanizaki, for instance.&nbsp; The question in the course title is one I asked myself as I began putting together the anthology I mention above in the late 1990s. How was one to conceive of a tradition called &#39;Indian literature&#39;? Was it the total of the various literatures of India? Or was there another way of exploring this category? It was a time when the Indian novel in English and the idea of &#39;postcolonial literature&#39; had begun to dominate. How did the modernist and avant garde trajectories of literatures in the Indian languages fit into these relatively recent categorisations? One of my own reasons for rethinking and enlarging the frame had to do with my affinities with modernism as a reader and writer, affinities that seemed out of place post-Midnight&#39;s Children, but not so out of place within the experimental histories of&nbsp;modern Indian literatures themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The use of the word &#39;modern&#39; was, and is, deliberate, to point to developments that the term &#39;postcolonial&#39; doesn&#39;t address. The texts we&#39;ll read here would follow, without too much narrow systematising, &lsquo;Indian literature&rsquo; and the way its emergence from the late nineteenth century in various languages embodied the trajectory of modernity, modernism, the avant garde, and formal preoccupations in India. The course means to question the largely theme-driven, Anglophone parameters of the &lsquo;postcolonial&rsquo; that have been with us for some decades now.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

We will study major sites of art historical and cultural importance, while tracing their roots and interconnections to developments in art, religion, and aesthetics in Kashmir, Bihar and Tibet. The course focuses on studying monasteries and temples through their geographical location and landscape, their usage, and changes in structure and style in response to religious and socio-political developments as well as changes in local ecological conditions. The artistic strategies employed, the material used in making paintings and sculptures will be explored in relation to their geographic, architectonic and spatial contexts as well as the ritual requirements.</p>\n\n<p>The course emphasises the importance and processes of place-making through history, mythology and local belief systems, and how these impact the relationship of communities with sites. We will learn about processes through which lands and sites are &#39;recognised&#39; as being sacred; we will consider how places are experienced through the senses; how do light, colour, smell and sound create affective ways of inhabiting sites? We will also study the transformations that occur when sacred material culture is moved from its site of usage in the Himalayas to museum contexts. The course includes field trips to two contemporary Buddhist sites in Delhi, where we will make site drawings and detailed ethnographic notes on the human relationship to place and site.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>By the end of this course, students:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Will be familiar with the basic history of the development of Buddhism and Buddhist cosmological concepts.</li>\n\t<li>Will be able to identify major deities of the &lsquo;Tibetan&rsquo; Buddhist pantheon and identify stylistic features of early Himalayan Buddhist art.</li>\n\t<li>Will be conversant with major Buddhist temples and monasteries in Tibet, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh, as well as early sites in the Kashmir Valley.</li>\n\t<li>Will have the ability to &lsquo;read&rsquo; the architectural layout, structure and form of sites, and study the architecture, sculptures and paintings in relation to their usage.</li>\n\t<li>Will be familiar with developments in the art of the region in conjunction with changes in religion and socio-political contexts of patronage.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Select/ Preliminary Reading List:</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n● Brauen, Martin.

What do the bodies produced in mapped territories look like? What bodies exist in unmapped terrains? What is the relationship between wonder/amazement, and control/annihilation? Where do we locate ourselves as scholars reading these maps? What maps are visible when we visit the landscape? How are narratives produced against maps? How are histories made visible in terrain?</p>\n\n<p>These questions will guide us as we traverse a theoretical terrain of writings on space and territory, and situate ourselves in specific historical moments of imperial mastery over space. We will cover a lot of ground temporally but our geographic focus will be South and East Asia.

While photographic images&nbsp;stand&nbsp;for&nbsp;real/truth of an image, ie,&nbsp;&#39;this exists&#39; in a moment in time, it is also a framing device; it is an apparatus that lends itself to&nbsp;re-presentation and reproduction of an image.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While a still image captures the fleeting momentary aspect of a world we live in, it represents this moment in specific ways. It reproduces this moment, frames it and imbues it with the subjectivity of the photographer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is this aspect of photography that this assignment explores, especially in relation to early photographic folios, albums and other incunabula as Walter Benjamin points out to us.</p>\n\n<p>Note:&nbsp; Sequentiality and Repetition could be utilised to hold certain directorial vision or poetic aspects to the narrative. Also you could utilise&nbsp;the inherent qualities of a photograph- that a photograph&nbsp;manages to capture&nbsp;a fleeting moment of a second (shutter speeds), as well as varying qualities of light (aperture);&nbsp;&nbsp;it captures certain frames that human eye cannot capture, including a point of view where human eye may not be able to reach.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Module 3: Photography and Identities:</p>\n\n<p>Reading:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christopher Pinney&nbsp; (1997) - Camera Indica&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter- Chamber of Dreams</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan Sontag&nbsp;&nbsp; (1973)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Photography&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter- On Melancholy</p>\n\n<p>Practice exercise:</p>\n\n<p>Assignment 3: Shifting from the premise of photography as that representing a reality, create a series of images that provide a convincing impression of a construction and framing of a tableau.

It will focus on some of the dominant traditions of historical writing, and the internal dialogues within the traditions. It will move from positivism to critical theory, from Marxism to the Annales, from the French historical tradition to English social history, from histories of the economy to histories of sensibilities and emotion, from Foucault&rsquo;s discursive turn to Michel de Certeau&rsquo;s focus on everyday practice. Through this journey, we will reflect on some of the binaries that often shape historical thinking &ndash;&ndash; the questions of history and myth, certainty and ambiguity, objectivity and prejudice, truth and falsehood &ndash;&ndash; and see how these notions are questioned and rethought over time. If historians in the nineteenth century established some of the founding premises of the historian&rsquo;s craft, the &lsquo;critical turn&rsquo; from the 1970s has powerfully questioned many of these assumptions, underlining the complex nature of historical practice. It has persuaded historians to ask: what does it mean to enter the archive and mine the traces of the past, to read the record, to see and represent, to narrate, and to write a story based on evidence? This course will explore what this critical turn has meant to the writing of history, how it has forced historians to question earlier frames, opening up new worlds of research, and how the old questions of historical evidence and verification still remain critical to the historian&rsquo;s craft. <strong>Structure</strong>: For some themes there will be one lecture, for others two, and some themes will be explored through student led discussions. On some days, there will be a film screening followed by a discussion on the film. We will explore how the film resonates with the themes of our concern.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance: Attendance is mandatory. Up to 5 absences are allowed (5 in LS and 5 in DS). After that there will be a grade cut for each absence unless supported by proper documentation. Assessment: There are no exams for this course. The structure of assessment will be as follows: (1) 5 short response papers/presentations on readings (5 x 6 = 30 percent of total credits), (2) a collective presentation (in small groups) = 10 percent, (3) active participation in lecture and discussion sessions = 10 percent, (4) an end semester essay of 2500-3500 words = 50 percent of total credits. The course has 4 parts. You can choose any 6 readings from those suggested (no more than 2 from one part) and write short response papers of about 400 -500 words each, capturing the arguments and stating your reactions to the text. These will be discussed in the class on scheduled dates. The end semester essay will be on a theme selected by the student in consultation with me, and the draft will be discussed in separate discussion groups, each with 5-6 students. Students can rework the essay after the presentation and submit the final draft for assessment. No essay will be accepted without discussion</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/Reading History Course Outline -Spring 2025_153f8162-0ac1-480f-9a3a-8ae4794efd2d.pdf'>Reading History Course Outline -Spring 2025_153f8162-0ac1-480f-9a3a-8ae4794efd2d.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

In order to understand the complexity of the socio-political discourse that was developing under conditions of colonial modernity during this time (roughly between 1857 &ndash; 1947), students will be introduced to seminal writings of major thinkers and political leaders of South Asia who influenced the socio-political struggles in the subcontinent on issues such as nation formation, religious reform, the caste system, the role and place of &lsquo;tradition&rsquo; and &lsquo;modernity&rsquo; on questions such as women&rsquo;s empowerment. We will focus on key primary texts, including autobiographies, speeches, dialogues, treatises, letters, ethnography, and literary fiction. We will also read relevant secondary texts to supplement the primary readings for a better understanding of the historical context as well as to gain an understanding of the discursive environment within which these debates are discussed in contemporary scholarly works.

The student will learn by themselves by bringing waste paper and doing the process themselves and start making paper mache. Then they will be introduced to the fundamentals of modeling relief and making armature for sculpting by using wire and mesh. Then they will be introduced to the historic and contemporary usages of paper mache by artists, through slide shows and presentations. After this they will be taught how to prepare a mould and how paper mache could be casted with the moulds. We will also be going through the process of making paper mache moulds and how to cast directly from objects using paper mache.

A collective space, it warrants proximity, energy, enthusiasm and a viscerality of a kind that makes it a very infectious space. Street-theatre is both a form and a place, it lends itself to the relatively &ldquo;loud&rdquo; variety of expression that cannot be free from the compunctions of a public space where opinions are made and unmade. In this course we will examine some popular opinions that are opaquely present in our midst today. &nbsp;We will work in teams to research facts about these opinions, examine the medium of here-say upon which they popularly ride, and enact scenarios that such opinions can cause and control in order to offer the public a larger, more realistic perspective from a human angle.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>We will devise and present a&nbsp;short street play at the end of the term.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>None</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Grades will depend upon your attendance (only 2&nbsp;absences are allowed), your class participation, your&nbsp;contribution in making the play, and then your performance in the final presentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>20% Attendance and regularity</p>\n\n<p>40% Class participation</p>\n\n<p>40%: FInal presentation&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>As we will be meeting only once a week, and because the nature of our work will be practical, more than two absences will not be allowed trough the term.&nbsp;Our work, both the devising and rehearsing will require regularity and absences can adversely effect the quality of our learning and final outcome.

The course is structured to acquaint the students with both mainstream and critical approaches to the subject, examining how these theories conceptualize &lsquo;the international&rsquo; as a field of study. &nbsp;The course is divided into three sections: the first section of readings review the state of the field and its origins, asking whose voices have dominated IR and whose interests and perspectives they represent. The second section provides an overview of the various theoretical frameworks that have come to challenge the mainstream perspectives in IR. The last section of the course concerns the future of the discipline highlighting some of the pertinent issues and questions to be addressed by the discipline including environment, global health, cyber threats and the rise of AI among others. The overall objective of the course is to give students a broad grounding in the wide theoretical terrain of the field and to sensitize students to differences in the nature of knowledge claims (epistemology) and fundamental assumptions about social/international reality (ontology) as well as political and ethical implications of different theoretical approaches in IR.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There are four components of grading- which is based on&nbsp;continuous assessment throughout the semester.</p>\n\n<p>A) Attendance and Class participation (15%)<br />\nB) Midterm Assessment: In Class Examination (30%)&nbsp;<br />\nC) Reflections on Theory (15%)&nbsp;<br />\nD) End Semester Essay (40%)</p>\n </div></div>",

Foreign Policy Analysis is much more granular because it examines how policymakers decide. As you will learn, actual decision-making is always messier than what grand theories imply. So, from the grand and the &lsquo;macro&rsquo;, we look on the domestic, state, organizational, and personal levels to understand the multitude of factors that affect a country&rsquo;s foreign policy. In order to do this, we make use of various conceptual lenses: theories of rational choice and alternatives to rational choice, individual/group psychology, emotions, culture/identity, and more. In a way, this course will be an exercise in unlearning IR Theory 101.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are the kind of questions that this class will help you think about? Perhaps questions such as &lsquo;Why did the United States respond to the discovery of Soviet missiles in Cuba with a blockade rather than any other possible response?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Why do state leaders sometimes choose policy options with a high risk of failure while less risky options are available?&rsquo;, &lsquo;How did domestic politics impact US-Iranian relations in the early twenty-first century?&rsquo;, &lsquo;How did Nehru&rsquo;s experience of colonial subjugation shape his ideas of non-alignment?&rsquo;, &lsquo;What are the effects of social media on foreign policy?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Can small states be successful in their foreign policy and, if yes, under what conditions?&rsquo;.

The main objective of the course is to introduce you to the many approaches one can take when trying to understand, explain, and analyse foreign policy processes and decision-making.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>A basic understanding of Foreign Policy Analysis and how it converges with and diverges from systemic IR theory.</p>\n\n<p>Familiarity with several theories and core concepts of Foreign Policy Analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Ability to distinguish between different levels of analysis and how each of these entails&nbsp;varying approaches to research.</p>\n\n<p>Ability to question rhetorical justifications for prominent foreign policy decisions that may not explain them correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Ability to apply a Foreign Policy Analysis theoretical framework to a case of choice or to write a critique of such a theoretical framework.</p>\n</div></div>",

The course will offer a sweeping review of collective action by communities &ndash; villages caught between rebels and military as they collectively deliberate over whom to support, economic migrants in foreign soil who use informal networks to send money &lsquo;back home&rsquo;, neighbourhood groups who organise collective petitions to force the government to hear their demands, ethnic groups in conflict who mobilise for peace and reconciliation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following examples. In rural China, Lilly Tsai tells us, state officials embedded into temple networks of their home villages refrain from demanding bribes. In the absence of democratic institutions of accountability, temple leaders, on behalf of the community, reward upright officials with higher social standing. In Afghanistan, villages with strong councils (<em>jirga</em>) organise more successfully to ward off predatory behaviour from distant state officials. Similarly, communities organise for, but also against, rebel groups. In Mizoram, regions where villages were strongly interconnected through rotating church pastors witnessed greater rebel recruitment;&nbsp;the frequent exchange of information between well-connected villages reassured rebels that their secrets will not be leaked to security forces. In Colombia, in contrast, indigenous communities mobilised against FARC rebels. The ability of a community to organise collectively affects outcomes as varied as riots, prison violence, and the inner workings of the Sicilian Mafia. At the broadest scale, to echo Robert Putnam&rsquo;s celebrated work on Italy, robust connections across otherwise disparate communities enhances social capital, which in turn, &lsquo;makes democracy work&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>These anecdotes barely touch the surface of the critical role of community ties and networks in a diverse range of political phenomena &ndash; accountability, economic exchange (we will study how Hawala transactions work), civil war resistance, democracy, riots, and organised crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In order to understand communities and collective action, the course will survey both classical and contemporary exemplars from across the social science (admittedly with a strong focus on political science). We will begin with a thorough baseline understanding of the concept of collective action &ndash; why do groups struggle to organise toward a goal that each member desires and will benefit from? What are some of the well-known solutions to collective action problem?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Building upon this foundation, we will delve deeper into specific instances of collective action. To cite a few, we will study how closely-knit social networks (imagine a village where &lsquo;everyone knows everyone&rsquo;) can monitor their members (peer monitoring, in-group policing). We will uncover the nebulous concept of &lsquo;trust&rsquo;, that allows individuals to anticipate that their peers will honour their word when rational calculations should suggest otherwise. Of course, a course like this will remain incomplete without engaging with norms of reciprocity, solidarity and altruism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of the course, students should have a sound overview of some of the major debates surrounding collective action by communities. It will also reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This is a senior-level course and will follow the seminar format.

As a consequence, the molecular underpinnings of evolutionary processes remain at the periphery. In this advanced course, we aim to introduce students to the rich world of molecular evolution as well as the mechanisms thereof, starting with theory and ending with some techniques and real-world examples. The course is divided into two modules (M1: Sandeep Ameta, M2: Laasya Samhita;).&nbsp; The first&nbsp;module will cover the principles of directed evolution and how it can be used to evolve/select functional biomolecules for various applications. We will discuss various techniques&nbsp;used for aptamers/ribozymes, proteins, therapeutic antibodies, enzymes, and metabolic pathway evolution. Additionally, some recent developments in implementing machine learning in guiding directed evolution experiments will also be discussed.

How does water shape and is being shaped by social relations and cultural practices, and how do these interactions vary across societies and geographic scales? In what ways does&nbsp;power&nbsp;mediate people&rsquo;s access to and control over water? This course dives deep into various epistemological and ontological questions surrounding water.&nbsp;Water is life-giving and non-substitutable. A decade and a half ago, in July 2010, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that recognized the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right. Yet nearly a billion people in the world still lack access to safe drinking water, and&nbsp;water-related diseases and deaths remain pervasive, especially in the Global South. At the same time, water &ndash; and mega hydraulic projects in particular &ndash; remains a central preoccupation for most modern states. The recent years have also witnessed increased instances of water grabbing and privatization at a global scale, giving rise to water conflicts as well as processes of accumulation by dispossession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on a set of interdisciplinary literature, this course will provide students an in-depth cultural and political ecological understanding of water, with a special focus on South Asia. Students will also get to interact with some of the experts in the field who will be invited as guest speakers. Besides, field visits will be conducted within Delhi-NCR to help student with a firsthand understanding of issues related to urban water, sanitation, and water justice. At the end of this course, students are expected to have a grasp of:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>a. Conceptual tools and analytical lenses by which to understand the relations between water and society, embedded in relations of power and cultural practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>b. Historical processes of how different states &ndash; from the medieval empires to the neoliberal states of our time &ndash; have tried to control and govern water, and the socio-ecological implications of these interventions.</p>\n\n<p>c.

In Latin, it comes from &quot;archivum&quot; or &quot;archium,&quot; while in Greek, it&#39;s related to &quot;arkheion.&quot; This term not only referred to the place where important records were kept but also the people responsible for managing them, the &quot;archons&quot; or citizens.</p>\n\n<p>Archives are like a time capsule, preserving the past. They&#39;re unique to individuals, organisations and specific periods in history, so no two archives are the same. They serve as a reminder of everything we might forget but should always remember. Archives hold a special power because archives act as the keepers of our collective memories, providing a glimpse into the worlds of writers, artists, thinkers and organisations, that helps us understand the different worlds where the materials in the archives come from. They&#39;re like hidden treasure troves for storytelling enthusiasts, creative minds, artists and scholars.</p>\n\n<p><u>Exploring the Ashoka Archives</u>: The Ashoka Archives is building up to offer an incredible wealth of knowledge, stories, experiences, correspondences, and images. It&#39;s truly astonishing that such an amazing resource is now on campus. As an educational institution, it&#39;s exceptionally vital to emphasize that without an archive, a significant portion of cultural history, can get lost due to various reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Centred around the Ashoka Archives, this course aims to delve into distinctive viewpoints of scholars through active engagement with archives and the materials that pique their individual interests. Scholars will also delve into the dual role of archives, serving as both tools and points of reference for shaping their artistic and storytelling visions. A primary emphasis of the program will be to openly and candidly investigate how archival materials can be harnessed to spark new artistic possibilities. Through art, visual storytelling, graphic narratives, there&rsquo;s an opportunity for the scholars to reinvigorate and re-examine the information available but also to generate new creations and events that can themselves be archived, allowing the scholar artists to contribute their unique voices to the historical record.</p>\n\n<p><u>What this course is about</u></p>\n\n<p>The fundamental concept here is to utilize the Archive as a platform for artistic discussion and intellectual exchange. This will offer not only the institution but also scholars and practitioners a chance to develop fresh, critical, and imaginative methods to engage the public. This engagement will be based on the materials found in the Ashoka Archive. The emphasis lies on both the Archive itself and individual scholars, who will collaboratively produce knowledge, visual narratives, and expertise. The process is as crucial as the final results, ensuring that visual exploration aligns seamlessly with the creation of knowledge and artistic expression.</p>\n\n<p>The course is designed to empower scholars in conjunction with the Archive over a single semester:</p>\n\n<p>Creative Documentation: These projects will focus on creating content to enrich the archive&#39;s knowledge repository, ultimately leading to tangible outcomes such as mini-books, zines, and catalogues.</p>\n\n<p>Creative Projects: These initiatives aim to support creative expressions that interpret the archive&#39;s collections through visual stories, comics, artwork,&nbsp; photo books and other artistic endeavours. </p>\n\n<p>This approach can help the scholars in negotiating their findings, research and learnings through visual interpretations in multi-disciplinary formats that is much required in today&rsquo;s realm of information &amp; content, where visual storytelling is an alternate and a popular form of information, opinion and communication.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><u>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</u>: These learning objectives will guide scholars through the course, enabling them to not only delve into the archival materials available but also develop a skill set that combines historical interpretation, visual storytelling, and ethical considerations in presenting interpreted narratives inspired from the archive.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding Archives: Define the concept of archives and their significance in preserving historical records. Explain the role of university archives in the history making and the process of documentation within the framework of an academic institution.</p>\n\n<p>Research and Selection: Develop the skills to identify and select relevant materials from the university archive. Distinguish between primary and secondary sources and understand the value of primary materials in historical research.</p>\n\n<p>Visual Analysis: Learn to critically analyse visual materials, including photographs, documents, and artifacts. Identify key elements of visual analysis, such as authorship, date, context, and significance.</p>\n\n<p>Material Context: Gain an understanding of the historical context in which the selected materials were created. Recognize the broader historical events and societal influences that may have shaped the materials.</p>\n\n<p>Visual Storytelling: Master the principles of visual storytelling, including design, composition, and narrative. Develop the ability to create visually engaging and informative materials based on historical content. Explore the use of digital tools and design software for creating visual materials. Learn to articulate the stories and insights conveyed through visual interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>Ethical Considerations: Explore the ethical considerations when working with historical materials, including issues related to copyright, privacy, and cultural sensitivity. Learn to handle and cite archival materials with integrity and respect for the rights of individuals involved.</p>\n\n<p>Interdisciplinary Skills: Encourage interdisciplinary thinking by connecting historical materials with various academic disciplines. Foster the ability to draw insights and connections between archival content and other fields of study.</p>\n\n<p>Reflection and Analysis: Encourage critical thinking by reflecting on the impact of visual interpretation on historical understanding. Analyse the choices made during the interpretation process and their implications.</p>\n\n<p>Collaboration and Peer Review: Foster collaboration by engaging in peer review and constructive feedback with fellow students. Learn from others&#39; interpretations and perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>+ Final Project: the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to create a final visual interpretation project using materials from the university archive. the project to the class, showcasing the historical context, significance, and storytelling elements.</p>\n\n<p>OUTPUT PARTICIPATION: Though the output will be individual, the process of production will be based on archival research, short studio collaborations and conversations and work-in-progress presentations at regular intervals as discussed above.</p>\n\n<p>COURSE DELIVERABLES: Every student will be expected to develop, produce multiple research-based short visual stories and graphic narratives/ comics.</p>\n\n<p><u>COURSE MODULES</u>:</p>\n\n<p>The proposed modules aim to provide scholars with valuable skills in archival research, critical analysis, visual design, and storytelling while fostering a deeper connection to their university&#39;s archive and the materials available. The idea would be in exploring from the diversity of materials to create diversity of practice involved in visual interpretations. The core idea here will be to discuss the materials available to create forms and works that can bring new practice-based influences and ideas, their working process and explore the architecture of visual storytelling in these works.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 1-2: Introduction and understanding the University Archive</p>\n\n<p>In this initial module, scholars will be introduced to the concept of university archive. They will gain an understanding of what these archives are, why they are essential for preserving historical records, and how they play a significant role in documenting academic works, arts, historical materials etc.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 2-3: Understanding the Archives &amp; Research Skills and Selection</p>\n\n<p>Scholars will be initiated with practical skills for conducting archival research. They will receive hands-on guidance on searching for materials within the university archive&#39;s catalogue or database. The module will emphasize the importance of reliable sources and the value of primary documents in historical research. Scholars will be encouraged to select a specific topic or theme related to their interest or a particular collection within the archive.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 3-4: Selection of material + Analysing and Placing in Context</p>\n\n<p>In this module, the focus will be on how to critically analyse the materials selected by the scholars. They will delve into key elements of analysis, including authorship, date, context, and significance. Additionally, they will explore historical context, including the important events, and the broader historical backdrop. Scholars will be encouraged to ask probing questions about the materials they&#39;re examining and to uncover the stories and insights they hold. Scholars will also be sensitised how to handle and cite archival materials appropriately, with a strong emphasis on giving credit to the source and respecting the rights and privacy of individuals involved.</p>\n\n<p>Week 5: Presentation of final material selected + their visual ideas</p>\n\n<p>Selection and research of interesting archival material will be followed to process and distill the findings to create the core conceptual idea and be presented in the studio sessions for the benefit of collective brainstorming and discussions. These discussions with fellow classmates will led to an inter-disciplinary ideation and conceptualization, moving closer to shape and sharpen the core project ideas of the scholars. The scholars will also be expected to share the processing of their research findings along with their influences and inspirations.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 6-7: Mastering Visual Storytelling</p>\n\n<p>Moving on from research, the course will now discuss the working process of creating a visual narrative using multiple influences of form and genres. This will include detailed discussions on the various possibilities of the form i.e., different forms that can be explored - doodle narratives, popular comics, mobile based narratives, photo comics, design, layouts, page architecture, typography, sequential storytelling and the work process involved in each, enabling the students to make informed choices in sync with their ideas. Students will explore various tools and software for creating visual materials, and they&#39;ll discuss the strengths and limitations of popular software including open-source alternatives. Practical exercises will be provided to enable students to create engaging and informative visual materials, which may include designing inarratives, zines, or digital outputs.</p>\n\n<p>Week 8: Presentation of a final project draft followed by discussion on similar ideas &amp; influences</p>\n\n<p>The following week the students will be expected to present their ideas and preliminary drafts as scribbles/ sketches with fellow batchmates, followed by open discussions, suggestions and ideation to evolve a clear understanding to flesh out the final narrative. Peer review and discussion will be encouraged to facilitate mutual learning. Each scholar/ project will be further exposed to similar works through display and in-depth discussions on influences and ideas related to the project to lend a visual and storytelling perspective, enabling the practitioner to take one&rsquo;s work further.</p>\n\n<p>Besides creating multiple micro narratives through the semester, finally, the semester will move to its last weeks to create a bigger multi-page graphic narrative.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 9-14: Final completion with a mid-level presentation in week 8.</p>\n\n<p>A mid-level draft presentation will be shared in the studio to display the work in progress after 2 weeks then followed by the final 4 weeks or the end of the semester, ready for display, presentation and production. Studio presence in these weeks will be a must.</p>\n\n<p><u>PLEASE CHECK THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT FOR COMPLETE DETAILS</u><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><u>PREREQUISITES</u>: Research based on materials available in the Ashoka Archive, writing, basic drawing, basic research photography, working knowledge of design software like Photoshop, Canva, Krita etc.</p>\n\n<p><u>PRELIMINARY READING LIST</u>:</p>\n\n<p>1. &quot;Archives: Principles and Practices&quot; by Laura A.

From being a custodian of cultural artifacts in a museum, the role of a curator and the practice of curating have diversified extensively in the past decades. By beginning with the history of curating and the figure of the curator, this course will offer students an initial grounding on recent and global curatorial practices and models. It will unpack the challenges and possibilities of curating across art institutions such as museums, non-profit organizations, biennales, and commercial galleries. Further, with the help of case studies, it will investigate the interdisciplinary methods of curating that do not fit into neat institutional definitions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Students of this course will also undertake hands-on training in the existing conventions of curating and also delve into new and interdisciplinary methods. The cadence of this learning&nbsp; includes, research methodology, fundraising and management procedures, exhibition-making/ project production, publication, publicity, and programming.

The discussion topics include replication and pseudoreplication, randomisation, sample size and degrees of freedom, orthogonal design, and non-orthogonal observational data. The topics on statistical modelling include parameter estimation, model prediction, overfitting, collinearity, missing data, approaches to choosing models, and model simplification. This course will be taught through lectures and worksheets using the R programming language. The example datasets used in the worksheets will be from ecological, biomedical, and social sciences.</p>\n\n<p>Statistical modelling is as much art as it is a craft.

Or maybe you do. Who knows, and who cares, because either way, a general understanding of key legal concepts &ndash; and the ability to think like a lawyer &ndash; will add invaluably to your arsenal as you step out into the real world. This knowledge and skillset will make you a distinctly sharper leader in the business world, because legal issues routinely &ndash; and increasingly &ndash; strike at the heart of business risks and opportunities, and are integral to overall corporate strategy. And so not just lawyers but a wide range of business executives (including C-suite executives) and their advisors routinely work on legal issues alongside lawyers. Legal roles are increasingly business roles, and vice versa. Therefore, the knowledge and skills this course provides will make you a sharper entrepreneur, or a sharper business executive, or a sharper consultant to businesses across sectors. But that&rsquo;s not all. The benefits extend to countless roles even beyond the business world: you&rsquo;ll be a sharper problem-solver regardless of field. To this end, the course will explore key concepts across several fundamental areas of law including contracts, torts, constitutional, criminal, administrative, competition, and procedural &ndash; each of which is applicable across a wide range of professional fields. The course will explore these concepts in two jurisdictions: India and the U.S. The course will also introduce students to thinking (and related) skills fundamental to not just the legal profession but also to the many professional roles (discussed above) that require frequent engagement with the law or with lawyers. These skills include: contract construction and interpretation; analyzing and applying a case; textual interpretation more broadly; analytical writing; persuasive writing; persuasive verbal argument; and highly analytical thinking with unrelenting precision, agility, and creativity.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/%5BSPRING 2025%5D Law and Lawyerly Thinking_4eb7f83e-5e9d-4ec3-bc6c-cf43114823cd.pdf'>[SPRING 2025] Law and Lawyerly Thinking_4eb7f83e-5e9d-4ec3-bc6c-cf43114823cd.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

On top of that, qualitative/interpretivist methods are often viewed as &lsquo;airy-fairy&rsquo;, soft, &amp; inconclusive as opposed to the solid, robust &amp; conclusive nature of quantitative research. This course aims to demolish all these myths and drive home the following points &mdash; qualitative/interpretivist method research is fun, challenging, nuanced, and as &lsquo;robust&rsquo; as conventional positivist research. Furthermore, the course is rooted in the belief that the binaries of qualitative/quantitative or interpretivist/positivist are not only exaggerated, but also unhelpful.</p>\n\n<p>Now, given the enormity of the tasks at hand, the course will be challenging (which is not the same as difficult). Which means, that you will be required to read a lot, reflect, engage, critique, and apply. You have been warned.</p>\n\n<p>Objectives</p>\n\n<p>The aims of the course are fourfold:</p>\n\n<p>First, to not just study methods/methodology in instrumentalist terms, but to root ourselves in philosophy of science - so we start with Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos to understand the nature of scientific inquiry. Then, we try to overturn all of them by reading Feyerabend&#39;s provocative treatise &#39;Against Method&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the module covers foundational literature on how to select one&#39;s case studies, along with basics such as conceptualization and operationalization. After that, we deep-dive into the methods themselves - discourse analysis, visual analysis, ethnography, quantitative text analysis, interviews etc.</p>\n\n<p>Third, the module&#39;s aim is also to acquaint you with exemplars (mostly) of qualitative research from Pol Sci/IR - to show you how things have been done, and to provoke you into thinking how they could have been done better. For instance, we see how James Scott&#39;s ethnography uncovered micropolitics of resistance in Southeast Asia, or how Carol Cohn stumbled upon the masculinized/sexualized world of defence intellectuals in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, we try to get our hands dirty and do some discourse analysis ourselves. So, a workshop will be organized where students try analyzing a text of their choice - which could be a film, piece of music, novel, or a government record.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Syllabus (Tentative)</p>\n\n<p>Week 1: What is social reality?</p>\n\n<p>Monday:<br />\nIntroduction<br />\n<br />\nWednesday:<br />\nE.H.

But how are these inter twined, or overlapping, divergent and for whom and how?</p>\n\n<p>The course looks at different and contrasting cases in the 20th century in different kinds of polities and economies, nations and empires.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Nature and nation explores the changing relationships of nature and nationalisms mainly in the 20th century world.&nbsp; Even though nation states are modern entities they often claim ancient lineage not only in language or culture but also with reference to a mountain, a tree, a river or an animal.&nbsp; The symbolic importance of natural entities apart, these are also subject of contest nowhere perhaps as evident as in the way around 1900 the very classes that had almost hunted the bison to extinction in the US became its protectors. Why did this change occur and was it a sign of a new kind of nationalism. The latter could include as well as exclude and it is no coincidence that the bison parks and the Indian reservations came about within the same decade.</p>\n\n<p>Nature also is important for nation states to generate more wealth and this competition between them is a major driving force of environmental change in today&rsquo;s world. Yet as with previous empires, Ottoman, French or British empires do attempt also to regulate nature and its use and abuse. Who speaks for nature how and why is itself worth careful study.&nbsp; This paper offers opportunity to look in comparative ways for instance at how capitalist and communist states, dictatorships and democracies have approached the problem of nature. Often as in post-apartheid South Africa, the legacies of the past and the racial divide remain important as parks game and wildlife mattered hugely to the white minority who governed till 1994. How does nature confer legitimacy and in what ways?</p>\n\n<p>This course takes special effort to look at societies often outside our gaze but subject to in depth research, such as Russia, China and Vietnam, Brazil as well as Scotland, Germany and France. An individual book review by each student with a short class talk is a must though it bear emphasis there will be due consideration we will use the particular case to approach general themes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By the end of term each of you will be able to think about this question in an original way.</p>\n\n<p>Why wne and how nature comes to matter to what a nation means and to whom is a critical issue in today&#39;s world: in this sense this course could be of value to any student today.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Reading list</p>\n\n<p>These are among the books that could be reviewed.</p>\n\n<p>Sections will be pre assigned either to class as a whole or to groups of five and we will debate why the piece matters and what insights it provides.

Such systems are referred to as Smart Materials as they can quickly respond to certain external stimuli such as temperature, light, pH etc.</p>\n\n<p>Smart Materials find a wide range of applications in biological as well as device-based applications. Houses having windows coated with smart materials can keep the house cool during the hot summer days by preventing the heat penetration, and same time can generate electricity as well. Self-healing materials can repair small fractures caused by applied stress and thereby increase the lifetime. For example, if car gets scratches, it may heal itself. Smart biomaterials have recently evolved as a highly fascinating area to become an integral component in the modern-day improvement of human condition and quality of life. These are said to impact the modern medicines in various ways. Tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, medical devices are some of the areas where smart biomaterials have significant role to play. Nevertheless, apart from biomedicine, biomaterials also play a crucial role in developing green technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Under this course, we will study about the various types of smart and biomaterials that find applications in biomedical sciences, electronic materials, and modern displays. We will learn the fundamental principles behind properties that make them unique in their classes. Topics that will be discussed in more details are Hydrogels, Self-healing materials, Liquid crystals, and brief introduction to single molecule electronics and molecular machines. Different classes of natural biomaterials including their properties and functions will be discussed. Design of synthetic biomaterials that requires knowledge and understanding of chemistry, materials science, biology, engineering, and medicine, will be covered. The course has been designed to provide students a comprehensive idea and in-depth understanding of biomaterials.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course contents</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;Introduction: Smart Functional and Biomaterials: Optical Materials, Shape Memory Systems, Materials for drug delivery, Tissue engineering etc.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>Soft Matterials</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Introduction: hydrogels and their applications</li>\n\t<li>Chemistry behind solidification of liquids (water)</li>\n\t<li>Forces responsible for gelation: Noncovalent molecular interactions</li>\n\t<li>Structural features of a gelator: Amphiphiles</li>\n\t<li>Characterization of a gel&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Self-healing materials</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Introduction to self-healing materials and their applications</li>\n\t<li>Design of self-healing and self-restoring materials</li>\n\t<li>Chemistry behind self-healing process</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Smart Optical Materials</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Chromogenic Materials</li>\n\t<li>Photochromic compounds: Chemistry and application in ophthalmic lenses</li>\n\t<li>Smart transparent glass</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Organic light emitting devices (OLED)</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Introduction: light emitting devices (LED)</li>\n\t<li>Emission of light: Fluorescence &amp; Phosphorescence</li>\n\t<li>Developmental history of LED</li>\n\t<li>Work principle of LEDs</li>\n\t<li>Materials used in LED</li>\n\t<li>Drawbacks of LED</li>\n\t<li>Organic LED (OLED): Generations of OLED</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Liquid Crystals</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Liquid crystals and their applications</li>\n\t<li>Types of liquid crystals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>5.&nbsp;Introduction to Biomaterials &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>6.&nbsp;<strong>Natural Biomaterials</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Structure and properties of cell components (proteins, DNA, carbohydrates)</li>\n\t<li>Biocompatibility</li>\n\t<li>Mechanical property/elastic moduli</li>\n\t<li>Biodegradability</li>\n\t<li>Cell-matrices interaction/ host response to foreign materials</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>7.&nbsp;<strong>Artificial/synthetic Biomaterials</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Natural materials-based (proteins and peptides like collagen, Cellulose)</li>\n\t<li>Polymer-based (Poly(methyl methacrylate ))</li>\n\t<li>Ceramics (Hydroxyapatite)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>8.&nbsp;<strong>Applications</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Next generation medical implants like artificial tissue, dental implants, vascular grafts</li>\n\t<li>Interface of biotechnology and engineering</li>\n\t<li>Green energy harvesting</li>\n\t<li>Bioelectrodes and biomedical sensors</li>\n\t<li>An emerging industry</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Student will learn</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>About various systems that are categorized as smart materials.</li>\n\t<li>Smart materials have huge industrial importance and are materials for future devices.</li>\n\t<li>This course will offer a basic understanding about the design and working principle.</li>\n\t<li>Topics that will be discussed in this course are from modern day research &amp; technology problems and are still under developmental stage.</li>\n\t<li>The fundamental concepts of materials science as applied for biomaterials science.</li>\n\t<li>Biological properties need to be evaluated to understand the potential of a system as biomaterials.</li>\n\t<li>The preparation and properties of different artificial biomaterials.</li>\n\t<li>Concept of designing new biomaterials</li>\n\t<li>Understand the huge range of potential applications of biomaterials that makes them one of the most promising future materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><u><strong>No Pre-requisite for this course.</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Polymeric and Self Assembled Hydrogels; From Fundamental Understanding to Applications.

As the name suggests, stereochemistry is the branch of chemistry that explores the properties of any compound that depend on the three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms/groups in the molecule. Compounds studied under this topic have identical chemical structures. Such compounds, called as stereoisomers, despite having exactly same elemental composition and formula may display huge differences in their properties, especially the way they interact with biological systems. A very basic example is found in the naturally occurring sugars which predominantly have D-chirality. We all know that the D-glucose is primary source of energy but L-glucose is totally different in that aspect. It is quite commonly observed fact that a particular enantiomer of the drug is biologically active while other remains silent. All this could be explained if their stereochemical aspects are considered. This course is designed to provide explanation about how certain subtle differences in spatial arrangements of atoms/groups in a compound can give rise to prominent effects. Stereochemistry is of particular importance in the field pharmaceuticals industry where it can provide great insights about designing new drugs.</p>\n\n<p>This course will also have some selected topics from heterocyclic chemistry. The contents within this part will provide a broad understanding of the major classes of heterocyclic compounds. &nbsp;Emphasis is given on the nomenclature, structure, properties, syntheses, and reactions of the simple 5 and 6-membered ring heterocycles, such as pyridines, pyrroles, furanes, thiophenes, indoles, quinoline and isoquinolines.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Course contents:</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction &amp; Applictions:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Importance of stereochemistry in real life: some examples and a short history of stereochemistry, experiments &amp; methods</li>\n\t<li>The Significance of Chirality in Drug Design and Development</li>\n\t<li>Chemistry in 3D space, Chirality and its origin</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Nomenclature and Terminology:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Absolute (R/S and D,L) and relative configurations</li>\n\t<li>Stereoisomers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Conformatonal Analysis and its effect on recativities:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Conformations of acyclic systems and of cyclopentane and cyclohexane (mono and disubstituted)</li>\n\t<li>Stereoelectronic and steric principles in reactions: Substitution, elimination and addition; selectivity and specificity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Chemistry of Heterocyclic compounds: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Introduction, Importance, Classification and nomenclature</li>\n\t<li>Structure, aromaticity in 5-numbered and 6-membered rings containing one heteroatom</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>General Synthetic Methods of some Biologically and Medicinally imporant Heterocylcic Compounds:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>General methods of synthesis for: Furan, Pyrrole, Thiophene, Pyridine, Indole, Quinoline and isoquinoline</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n\n<p>-Stereochemistry by Eliel</p>\n\n<p>-Stereochemistry by Nasipuri</p>\n\n<p>-Introduction to the Chemistry of Heterocyclic compounds, John Welly&amp; Sons (1976) by R.M.

While delving into different case studies of wars and conflicts both within and outside India, we will evaluate the possibilities and limitations of different causal explanations of&nbsp; warfare, and their embeddedness within diverse traditions of strategic thought, including from within Asia, as well as Western Europe. Through these discussions, we will explore why explanations about war have to be contextualized within developments of the nineteenth and twentieth century, and how the nature of its conduct, justification, as well as planning, is also shaped in complex ways by experiences of colonialism and Decolonization. Finally, we will evaluate the role of access to technology, and how decision-making structures within military and governmental institutions serve as the means to contain or to further proliferate war.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The Evolution of &lsquo;IR&rsquo; and Origins of the &ldquo;Causes of War&rdquo; Debate</p>\n\n<p>The discipline of IR owes its origins to an analysis of the causes of the First and Second World Wars. Pioneers of the field, including Hans Morgenthau and E. H. Carr, wrote texts (including, for instance, The Twenty Years Crisis, which we will discuss in class) that were foundational to the discipline of modern IR, because of an overwhelming urge amongst western policy makers during the interwar period to analyze the failures that led to the two World Wars, and how they could be prevented in the future. While tracing the progression of this debate, we will also develop an understanding of how the modern discipline of IR took root and evolved. This module will offer an overview of some of the most influential interventions in this field while asking: are these adequate for shaping a complete explanation of how all modern War comes about?</p>\n\n<p>E.

In particular, we will examine the nature and legacy of Nehruvian internationalist thinking on the India&rsquo;s decision-making processes for war and peace.

As the readings below will also show, aspects of war-making and violence in post-colonial societies defy easy distinctions between a state of &lsquo;War&rsquo; or &lsquo;Peace&rsquo; in many parts of the world today.

The course will explore emerging law and policy issues in the context of the internet and technology &ndash; in India and key foreign contexts including the U.S. and Europe. Given the increasingly pervasive nature of the internet and technology, these issues bring new and critical implications for a wide variety of professionals and businesses including but not only startups and other entrepreneurial initiatives; for society at large; and for the roles that businesses can play in society. These issues also transcend national boundaries, and routinely reflect and influence complex interactions between different nations. The course will address issues including data privacy; free speech and content moderation; competition; Artificial Intelligence; and others &ndash; and also distill practical skills and insights that cut across the various substantive issues discussed in the course. In doing so, the course will help prepare students to navigate, critically evaluate, and shape tech law and policy as part of the business world and more broadly &ndash; in India and globally &ndash; drawing from the instructor&rsquo;s first-hand leadership experience in crafting and executing innovative, high-impact strategies in the field.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/%5BSPRING 2025%5D Tech Law and Policy %28PolSci cross-list%29_53894fb8-d71c-4d86-8ab5-e2ecbebe94fc.pdf'>[SPRING 2025] Tech Law and Policy (PolSci cross-list)_53894fb8-d71c-4d86-8ab5-e2ecbebe94fc.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

Students will be introduced to an expanded understanding of Media in its older and more contemporary forms. Various media will be introduced with questions about power, access, hierarchy, ownership, control, and other forms of hegemony. Media will be seen in its mainstream, alternate forms that create distinct breakage in tight binaries. The course will look at art making as a tool to develop probing questions and expressions through a base in fictional, non-functional routes or intensities of expressions, encouraging work in visual, textual and other forms of media and its possibilities of proliferation. Participants will be introduced to selected arts and artists of the 20th C,&nbsp;&nbsp;pivotal points in Art histories where artistic forms punctured the social fabric through critical media interventions. Media and its modern forms of proliferation will be explored &ndash; duplication, imprints, text, printing, photography, still images, and moving images will be experimented with to understand the possible reach, potential, and distribution of the forms. We will conceptualise&nbsp;social, cultural, and intellectual aspects of our lives and create expressive forms through the politics of media and mediation.</p>\n\n<p>Methods:<br />\nThe course will introduce an expanded discourse on art and media and the relevance and political choices of media forms in making art a critical expression. The course will enable work with drawings, doodles, journaling, artists&rsquo; books/forms of print and publishable material - from T-shirts to blogs will be seen as social and spatial interventions creating ruptures in a social context and as a public exposition of ideas. Participants will develop lines of enquiry &ndash; through media forms &ndash; as narratives, intermedia interventions (posters, zines, poems, oral Storytelling, conversation), pop up exhibition making and other critical forms of media to address the notions of art and making of its Public, its Viewers, audience or its consumers. Channels for information and communication will be seen as mediums to investigate and experiment in creating artistic practice. 2 Dimensional 3 Dimensional works and their relation with time and space. Specific forms of media will be explored to locate contingencies of circulation and institutionalised structures of dissemination of ideas. Artistic forms will be explored and developed as possible tactics and tools of communication through interventions, provocations and reflections in social/political/cultural contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Module 1:</strong> Abstraction and Media.

For example, we will consider how the distant developments of the Cold War were also of relevance in shaping India&rsquo;s position in the world. Furthermore, we will examine how the developments of the Cold War were equally shaped, not just by the superpowers, but also by smaller, poorer, and recently decolonized countries. Enabling an evaluation of why developments unfolded in the way that they did during the Cold War, therefore, the course will show how the appraisal of events from more than a single point of view, is necessary to understand the impact of the Cold War more fully on present day international politics.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will also explore the newer directions of the historiography on the Cold War, including the ways in which its debates influenced popular culture and the international perceptions of technological aid.

The course will focus on evidence related to caste and sex in India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first part of the course will take students through theories of discrimination such as statistical discrimination and taste for discrimination, based on the work of Kenneth Arrow, Gary Becker and George Akerlof.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will lead to a discussion of the overlap between economics of discrimination and related sub-disciplines that are relatively new but are rapidly expanding, viz., &ldquo;Identity Economics&rdquo;, pioneered by George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton, &ldquo;Feminist Economics&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Stratification Economics&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The second section will introduce students to concepts in social psychology such as stereotype threat and implicit bias that produce discriminatory outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The third part of the course introduces students to some of the key methods of empirically gauging discrimination in market settings. This section would familiarize students with decomposition analyses applied to the labour market (what part of the wage gap between two groups is due to differences in abilities, and what part is due to discrimination), using standard techniques from Labour Economics. We would also discuss experimental methods &ndash; both field-based as well as lab-based experiments to gauge discrimination outside the labour market (e.g. housing market), or in the field of charitable giving, or even in labour markets but during the job search process (before applicants find jobs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Students will be familiarized with literature that applies these methods in the Indian context, particularly to the study of caste and gender discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The final part of the course will deal with policy options to deal with group-based disparities and discrimination, with a focus on affirmative action policies. This section will outline the various types of affirmative action, including quotas or reservation, and discuss debates around affirmative action, focusing on evidence-based research gauging its impact.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course Outline and Reading List&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Note: This reading list could see minor changes during the semester which will be announced well ahead of time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does social identity shape economic outcomes?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Akerlof, George. 1984. &ldquo;The economics of caste and of the rat race and other woeful tales&rdquo;, in&nbsp;An Economic Theorist&rsquo;s Book of Tales, Cambridge University Press, 1984, models of statistical discrimination and the caste economy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Becker, Gary. 1957.&nbsp;The Economics of Discrimination,&nbsp;Chs. 1, 2 and 10</p>\n\n<p>Akerlof, George A. and Rachel Kranton. 2010.&nbsp;Identity Economics: how our identities shape our work, wages and well-being, Princeton University Press, Chs. 1-4, 7</p>\n\n<p>Eswaran, Mukesh: Why Gender Matters in Economics, Ch. 4</p>\n\n<p>Mario L.

As we shall see, such a view can offer a powerful framework for understandingeconomic development outcomes. It is also productive in suggesting new lines of enquiry. The main theoretical framework is drawn from models of structural transformation. While these are macro models, the empirical analysis uses the techniques of micro-econometrics. The course is heavily based on research papers - mostly published in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>To appreciate the research questions and to think of new questions, it is important to have the background knowledge in terms of institutions, technologies, endowments, preferences,policies and history. This is best acquired by self-reading.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>An indicative list of topics and readings are pasted below. &nbsp;These may change especially after conversations in our initial classes.</p>\n\n<p>1.

Students will learn how their post-graduation career journey<br />\nreflects the life cycle of an enterprise, from the risk-seeking stage of a startup,<br />\nthrough venture capital and private equity phases, to a more conservative, listed<br />\ncompany stage, where performance and adaptability are crucial to survival.<br />\nThough focused on unlisted investments, the course&rsquo;s primary goal is to develop the<br />\nability to: a) recognize and confront areas where we lack knowledge, b) identify the<br />\nissues critical to your success, and c) establish a mental framework for continuous<br />\nlearning and understanding. Students will also encounter the paralyzing effects of<br />\nfear of failure and the feeling of helplessness that can impede success&mdash;not just in<br />\ninvestments but in life decisions, including the choice to commit time and effort to<br />\nthis course.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/4%29 ENT-2034 - Demystifying Investments Private Equity and Venture Capital.docx_Course Outline_2a527c2c-b619-4d75-96fb-6e958df94f6b.pdf'>4) ENT-2034 - Demystifying Investments Private Equity and Venture Capital.docx_Course Outline_2a527c2c-b619-4d75-96fb-6e958df94f6b.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

Though we do not understand the phenotypic (or functional) implications of all variations in one&rsquo;s genome, our understanding of the human genome has seen great strides in the last two decades and we are now in a position to predict functional consequences of many changes that are seen in our genome. Genetic disorders are caused by changes in our genome and have been implicated in almost every disease known to man. It is said that &ldquo;if one goes into details, all diseases are likely to be genetic disorders&rdquo;. In this course we will recapitulate basic principles of genetics and introduce the concepts of human genetics. It is now clear that thousands of rare diseases are caused by genetic alterations and cancers are thought to be a form of genetic disorders. You will learn about the genetic basis of these diseases, how to diagnose and treat these diseases including some of the newer therapeutic approaches.

However it is important to remember that the Qurʾan, while being the foundational scripture of one of the world&rsquo;s largest religions, is also an important historic and literary document from Arabia of this time. In this course, we will explore the emergence of the Qurʾan (from Arabic qurʾān, &lsquo;reading&rsquo; or &lsquo;recitation&rsquo;) and read it as a religious, historic and literary document -firmly situated within the cultural and historical milieux of Late Antiquity (ca. 3rd - 8th century CE). This course will introduce you to two exegetical worlds, the historical-critical study of the Qurʾan and Islamic exegesis (tafsīr). Notwithstanding their different approaches, premises and biases, they both share a fundamental commitment to close and patient reading, and an enduring fascination with the text of the Qurʾan. The initial segment of the course will focus on tracing the Qurʾan&#39;s origins within its historical context. We will delve into the intertextuality of Qurʾanic narratives and their Jewish and Christian counterparts. In the second part of the course we will read together excerpts from the 18th chapter of the Qurʾan, called Sūrat al-Kahf, accompanied by the seminal commentary known as the Tafsīr al-Jalālayn (15 th century CE). Sūrat al-Kahf is a particularly fitting since it offers a unique window into the rich literary worlds of Late Antiquity. Within its verses, a diverse collage of characters, motifs, and narratives unfolds, ranging from enigmatic sleeping youths and the prophet Moses to Alexander&rsquo;s Doppelg&auml;nger Dhū l-Qarnayn.</p>\n</div></div>",

However, long before the modern desire for &ldquo;a room of one&rsquo;s own,&rdquo; women were already involved in rejecting the bonds of marriage and claiming their own spaces. These were not best-selling authors but women who chose lives that were dedicated to God. From Catholic nuns to Sufi saints, medieval women in disparate parts of the globe found agency, community and fulfillment in single lives. Perhaps not surprisingly, the choice to live attached to God, either in community or in solitude, resulted in some of the earliest women&rsquo;s writing.</p>\n\n<p>This course takes a global approach to writing and criticism that emerges out of medieval women&rsquo;s religious callings. From the letters of Hildegard von Bingen to the lyrics of Mechthild of Magdeburg to the vakhs of Lal Ded, we will track how devotion to god also constituted a refusal of heteronormativity. We will examine medieval writings alongside contemporary feminist, queer and theological theory to discern how celibate religious life, often lived in communities of other women, shaped medieval women&rsquo;s literary culture. We will consider how the writings that emerge from these devotional ascetic contexts framed women&rsquo;s relationships with God, with themselves, with each other and with the world. Finally, we will see whether these writings might offer us new frameworks for understanding gender, sexuality, and refusal today.</p>\n</div></div>",

They are instead a way of keeping thought in motion and preserving a critical potential against a status quo that is perfectly able to assimilate even what appears to stand outside and in opposition to it, both in the realms of activism and theory. Perhaps, as Adorno says, &ldquo;wrong life cannot be lived rightly,&rdquo; but dialectical thinking can at least be a means to begin to glimpse something better, however vague and fleeting that &ldquo;something better&rdquo; must remain. Such thinking, Adorno argues, is at once the simplest and the most impossible thing, but is ultimately &ldquo;the only philosophy which can be responsibly practised in the face of despair.&rdquo; In this class we will follow this line of thinking from the 1920s through the 1960s, exploring arguments about the status of art in an era of industrial mass culture, the failure of revolution and the catastrophe of fascism, the domination of nature, and also, for the record, false happiness peddled under late capitalism. Through readings and discussion we will situate their writings historically against the backdrop of Nazism, exile, and ultimately post-war conservative restoration, while also keeping an eye on what they might offer us in our own thinking about culture.</p>\n</div></div>",

By writing (and revising and revising again) we ask ourselves questions and investigate our opinions and those of others. In this way writing, is something like solving a puzzle or even a crime. Just as literary detectives ask questions about motive, means and opportunity to discern who the killer is in a thriller, when we write, we ask and answer a multitude of questions to solve our own set of mysteries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By taking detective fiction as its subject, this Critical Thinking Seminar will examine works such as the short stories of Edgar Alan Poe and Agatha Christie and the 2015 film Talvar with the aim&nbsp;to train you in skills necessary to the process of reading and writing about literature. Each of the critical skills&mdash;from close reading to developing an argument to forming paragraphs&mdash; is paired with a work of detective fiction to help you consider that skill and give you topics for writing assignments. In addition to reading detective fiction and watching a few detective films, we will read some secondary works about the genre of detective fiction. The goal of the course overall is to hone your skills in writing about literature by examining a genre of literature that mirrors the process of writing itself.</p>\n</div></div>",

Is it a text which is dense, complicated, and difficult to read &ndash; or a text which is frivolous, and silly, and romantic? Is a bad book one that often has themes we don&rsquo;t agree with, or racist and misogynistic representations of characters? Are they texts that are sold purely with commercial purposes in mind? Put simply, what do we think of when we think of Bad Books?</p>\n\n<p>Depending on class, position, level of education, or something as simple as the access to a library &ndash; our definitions of what is or isn&rsquo;t bad literature changes. This course is an exploration of discourses about Bad Books, the critical history of judgement behind them, and an analysis of contemporary tastemaking. To pass critical judgement on art is not something done in isolation &ndash; it often signals social class and affiliation, in-group knowledge that is often designed to include and exclude. Additionally, Bad Books are usually considered so because they are judged largely as commodities, as opposed to art, which is a distinction frequently drawn in the process of tastemaking. Moreover, what is considered bad literature, often hides a wealth of reading practices of its own &ndash; the most relevant example of which is fanfiction, which operates on a digital economy quite separate from the publishing industry. Through this course, we will try to understand the wealth of reading practices that are the basis for the tastemaking that might deem a text such as Twilight as trash, and one like Normal People as literature.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Over the course of this semester, I would like you to think about the kinds of biases that go into taste making &ndash; and the nature of studying literature as a whole. Since a lot of the texts we study in literature are broadly considered &ldquo;good&rdquo; reading (your personal and real opinions on Shakespeare, Austen, or any of the rest are welcome), it might be useful to look at literature slant, from an angle that we generally do not have the privilege to spend a lot of time thinking about.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, I would like this course to be one to bring your guiltiest pleasures, the texts you find most difficult to talk about in an academic environment &ndash; and hopefully decode what it is that you enjoy about these texts. Enjoyment is not, after all, something without theoretical force &ndash; and to have fun with reading is perhaps one of the rare affordances of studying literature that we can play with.</p>\n</div></div>",

They&nbsp; examine&nbsp;reality in ways that include elements of the scientific or the philosophical, but through&nbsp;a distinctive mode of imaginative consideration. The novel is a shapeshifting, open-ended genre.</p>\n\n<p>In this course, we will discuss&nbsp;the ways in which the novel and the world make, remake, and unmake&nbsp;each other. We will consider the history of the novel, including&nbsp;anachronisms and ruptures; we will think about the form of the novel, including departures&nbsp;and deformations, and we&#39;ll think about ways in which novels themselves reflect on acts of reading and interpretation. Our discussions and written work&nbsp;will take in&nbsp;politics and affect, aesthetics and&nbsp;materiality. Our&nbsp;focus will for the most part remain on fiction from the nineteenth century and twentieth centuries, with a few works by twenty-first century writers:&nbsp;canonical realist fiction (by writers such as&nbsp;Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Charles Dickens),&nbsp;more experimental literary fiction (including works by&nbsp;Virginia Woolf and&nbsp; Salman Rushdie),&nbsp;and some works&nbsp;of genre fiction (horror, detective fiction,&nbsp;science fiction, and so on) that are yet to be decided.&nbsp;As we read theories of the novel alongside these narrative works, we will think about the ways in which novels encourage us to get out of our skins, inhabit other ways of becoming and being, travel through time and space, and encounter new universes--or, as we like to call them in this course, novel worlds.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>1.

We will start with theoretical concepts of Gender formulations in psychology, history of gender struggle and rights movements, methodology and ethical issues in gender psychology research, and proceed towards exploring other psychological variables in gender. Throughout, the instructor will strive for a balance of introducing the class to literature that is cross-culturally pertinent.&nbsp; We will critically engage with psychological literature that have dealt with essentialization of gendered attributes, sexually dimorphic models that dominate evolutionary psychology and biomedical research spaces, as well as psychological literature that focus on gender similarity and investigate the reasons behind gender differences in psychological constructs and attributes. We will discuss why intersectionality has emerged as an important perspective in gender research.&nbsp;<strong>This course is, expressly, not just for womxn students</strong>. <strong>It is encouraged that men enroll for this class as well, because this class will be geared towards a discussion of ALL genders within a framework of psychological thought, and no discussion on gender is complete if&nbsp; half the population is excluded from it.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; This is an advanced seminar styled&nbsp;course with weekly discussions and flipped classrooms employed&nbsp; for most of the course, with didactic lectures only being a part of the entire 90 minute long class duration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Structure of the Course:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The first block of the course will provide a larger context for the class as well as gender movements and situate the importance of gender discourse in modern life. Second week onwards, the lectures will be followed by discussion classes on Thursdays where the class will be open to student presentations.</li>\n\t<li>Each lecture class will have instructor lectures followed by discussion for the day. The instructor may conduct class activities&nbsp; in small groups</li>\n\t<li>Each student will be responsible for TWO presentations, which can be individual or [paired or grouped , based on final class size. Presentations need to be 10 minutes long with 2 min Q/A time and will be graded (Total 12 minutes). Each discussion class will have space for 7&nbsp; presentation slots . Each discussion class will consist of student presentations on topics of their choosing but in tune with the topic of the week. There will be a roster alongside the course schedule spreadsheet.

The aim of this course is two-fold: to introduce (i) the basics of computer organization and architecture (COA), and (ii) the fundamentals of operating systems (OS). In the COA-part, students will learn how programs written in a high-level programming language are executed on a physical machine. What is the hardware-software interface? Does the underlying &ldquo;organization&rdquo; of physical resources define the &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; of a machine, or vice-versa? Which factors need to be considered for designing the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) so that the performance of the machine is optimized? We will highlight techniques for designing instruction set, and pipelining mechanism for the best utilization of hardware. Special emphasis will be given on RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer). In the latter part, students will learn how OS acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user for running applications. How the computer&#39;s resources, such as the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices are managed to ensure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. How multiple processes run on the same CPU without conflict?</p>\n\n<p>During the course we will walk through a selection from the following topics:</p>\n\n<p>Introduction: Evolution of computers, hierarchical design of computer systems, hardware/software interface. Models of computation, overall system organization: Basic functional blocks of a computer - CPU, memory, I/O subsystems, control unit. Instruction set architecture (ISA): registers, execution cycle, addressing modes. &nbsp;CPU Performance Equation, Amdahl&rsquo;s Law. RISC versus CISC machines.</p>\n\n<p>Instruction sets: Introduction to MIPS: operations, operands, and op-codes;&nbsp;MIPS assembly language.</p>\n\n<p>Computer arithmetic: Number systems &ndash; Fixed and floating-point binary number representation; Integer addition and subtraction, design of arithmetic logic unit (ALU):</p>\n\n<p>Processor design and Pipelining: Data path and control unit design, simple pipeline, hazards.</p>\n\n<p>Operating systems: Elementary concepts of an OS, process management, inter-process communication, threads and concurrency, CPU scheduling, the critical-section problem, semaphores.</p>\n\n<p>Memory management: Memory hierarchy; Cache architecture; Main memory; Virtual memory.</p>\n\n<p>Multi-Core and Multi-Processing (if time permits): Vector processing; Multithreading, Shared-memory multiprocessors; Graphics processing units; Clusters and cloud.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>At the end of the course, students are expected to learn how a complete processor is designed in order to support an instruction set architecture as well as how the OS runs in the background overseeing all operations.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Suggested Reading:</p>\n\n<p>1.

As the scope of applications expand beyond computer science into data driven decisions about humans and policy advocacy, we need better understanding of the risks and potential negative fallouts. This course will be a formal enquiry into ethics of data driven decision making that affect people.</p>\n\n<p>In the first&nbsp; part of the course we will analyse the shortcomings of the `prediction only&#39; paradigm. We will try to formalise the notions of predictability vs reliability, and examine the possibilities of defining suitable reliability measures. In this context, we will study adversarial attacks and the possibilities of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples. We will also investigate to what extent `causal inference&#39; can enhance reliability. We will try to examine the ethical issues in building `autonomous systems&#39; &nbsp;--&nbsp;such as self driving cars or even weapons --&nbsp;based solely on high prediction rates of modern machine learning systems (deep convolutional neural networks).</p>\n\n<p>In the second part of the course we will concentrate on fairness and bias. We will try to fomalise the criteria of fairness based on the understanding of discrimination that exist in the social sciences and law. We will see that unless the data lie in narrow well-behaved manifolds, most reasonable characterisations of fairness are impossible to achieve in data driven decision making.

It is an attempt to cross- fertilize and open up the possibility of doing an anthropology of medicine by carefully examining aesthetic objects such as literature and movies, and to introduce those who may be interested in movies and literature to the anthropology of medicine.</p>\n\n<p>There are roughly four provisional modules: epidemics/pandemics; trans-corporeality; psychiatry; pharmaceuticals. Or the movement of germs/viruses, body parts, mind/consciousness/souls, drugs/vaccines. Unlike possibly other courses, we intend, in large part, to shift the emphasis to the Anglophone world, particularly the United States of America, as the analytical object in an attempt to wean students away from India as an ethnographic object and towards a country with an abiding religious undercurrent, although it is formally a secular democracy and ostensible trend-setter of the contemporary world. This is partly to emphasize that it may be interesting to make the US rather than India labour under the trope of religion, and, thereby, befuddle received anthropological categories.</p>\n\n<p>We intend to do this by starting with a war game called Dark Winter run by the Department of Homeland Security in the US. Played purportedly in &ldquo;real time&rdquo;, with a sitting US senator playing the President of the US, it simulates a smallpox attack on the American Homeland. We will pair this with a movie on the Ebola virus, which escapes the nuking of an African village and arrives in the US piggy-backing on exotic pets shipped from the Congo to California. Against the backdrop of the lived experience of the pandemic, and the just concluded presidential election run as a &ldquo;Book of Revelation horrors&rdquo;, we will ask if epidemic imaginaries are harbingers of the apocalypse &ndash; as is the case with climate change &ndash; and how religion, especially late-nineteenth century American Dispensationalism, informs epidemics and pandemics. We may buttress this by drawing attention to the apocalyptic novels of the Left Behind thriller series, which by 2017 had not only sold 65 million copies but had spawned a mini industry of movies, video games, etc.</p>\n\n<p>We then intend to traverse the world of transplants: body parts, embryos, gene editing, double mastectomies; then move up the body to the ineffable entity called consciousness, which seems to perpetually slip away and evade capture by either medicine, philosophy, or religion, except perhaps by the Amerindians who seem to know where it is as they appear to make trans-corporeal soul transfers to make their dogs dream better; and finally, end with the pharmaceutical industry: one that promises redemption from pain and suffering, and even the possibility, through psychedelics, of tangible meetings with God; and, in the bargain, seems to deliver addiction and iatrogenesis.</p>\n\n<p>We invite students to step up and co-curate this experimental and neoteric effort by bringing visual and literary material to the table so that the modules and the trajectory sketched above may be brought to fruition. We would be more than happy to widen the ambit beyond the four modules if &ndash; given the constraints of time &ndash; we are persuaded to do so.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Readings: TBA a bit before the new term</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Grading: The list of readings/movies/literature &ndash; provisional &ndash; will be provided a bit before the beginning of term. Each student is expected to present roughly 5 to 8 readings (the exact number will depend on the size of the class). A &ldquo;reading&rdquo; may be chapters, articles, movies, comic strips, graphic novels, short stories, novels or essays; or a combination of any of them. The students are expected to present it in class on a designated day, to be specified in an Excel Sheet. The class presentation essay must consist of two components: 1) a summary essay of 400 words, and 2) a discussion essay of 400 words, in which the students may raise questions of the &ldquo;reading&rdquo;, relate it to other bodies of work, and offer interpretations/critiques in the light of their personal experience and/or general reading. Both components of the class presentation essays must be merged into a single file and uploaded to Google Classroom by Sunday midnight. It must also be sent to me and the TA/TF on our e-mail IDs. On the designated day of presentation, students must present their essays in class in 8-10 minutes. This will constitute two credits of the four-credit course. All students are expected to read/watch the assigned &ldquo;readings&rdquo;, and the essays written by their classmates prior to the class. The other two credits will be for an end-term essay of 4000-5000 words on a mutually acceptable topic chosen in consultation with me. The in-person class presentation essays, and the end-term essays, are both mandatory. Late submissions of either will attract a grade cut.2</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/MML_Naraindas_AU_Winter2025 %281%29_4c78bfa8-aef3-491c-85e0-e248d1324f29.pdf'>MML_Naraindas_AU_Winter2025 (1)_4c78bfa8-aef3-491c-85e0-e248d1324f29.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

How do anthropologists/sociologists study global phenomena? The concept of globalization has two distinct meanings. On the one hand, globalization denotes an ever-intensifying connectivity between societies, cultures, and regions across planet Earth. On the other hand, globalization denotes a normative project, one that empowers multilateral alliances and international law for governing cross-border connectivity. While scholars and the world public increasingly speak of the demise of globalization in the normative sense, societies are ever more connected, and transnational flows and crises are faster and more intense each day.</p>\n\n<p>This course introduces students to the main concepts, definitions, and theories that shape the scholarly conversation over globalization. However, the course is not merely theoretical. We will read essays on methods and examples of empirical research that inspire anthropologists and sociologists to design research proposals to study global phenomena in their interactions with local and national scales of social activity. By the end of the semester, students will develop a research proposal to study a global phenomenon of their preference by applying the main ideas and frameworks in the syllabus.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/What is Globalization Course Details Can Evren_61cfe049-7575-456c-a7d4-21fc24c4cf7c.docx'>What is Globalization Course Details Can Evren_61cfe049-7575-456c-a7d4-21fc24c4cf7c.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

Since the Enlightenment, &ldquo;mysterious incalculable forces&rdquo; have been replaced by accountable and calculable forces. Logs, metrics, models, and experiments replaced God, myth, and magic to render the world transparent. Yet, even as colonialism expanded Enlightenment values beyond Europe, the grotesque and the mythical survived the test of time. New and old enchantments, from raging wildfires to opulent godmen and shamans, proliferate modern society.&nbsp; This course will explore how our social worlds and institutions have been shaped by this overarching narrative of modernity- disenchantment. We will also examine how subjectivity, the affective, and the mythical are not rationality&rsquo;s evil other but rather are integral to its survival. Could re-enchanting scientific progress produce new forms of expertise in our modern world?</p>\n</div></div>",

This course will raise these timely questions in the context of two pivotal philosophical texts by Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) -- a Dutch radical rationalist philosopher who was excommunicated both by Jews and Christians for his pantheistic metaphysics and anti-establishment political views. The link between Spinoza&#39;s metaphysical monism and ethico-political pluralism will be explored in light of his deterministic promotion of individual freedom and his rich and complex theory of emotions and conatus (striving, drive to survive) and his anticipation&nbsp; of the idea of &quot;general will&quot;.

Proposition, Judgment, and Truth from Descartes to the Present [PHI-3435] [PHI-3435-1]</h4><div><strong>Faculty Name </strong><div class='cmsDescp'>Till Alexander Guntar Hoeppner [till.hoeppner@ashoka.edu.in] ;</div></div><div><strong>Overview</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>To be taught by Professor Till Hoeppner.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts or propositions play important roles in our understanding of our thinking, believing, and saying the things we think, believe, or say (for instance, &lt;the earth revolves around the sun&gt;, &lt;bodies are divisible&gt;, or &lt;2+2=4&gt;). These roles are as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(i) A thought is&nbsp;<em>that which is true or false</em>&nbsp;such that beliefs and (declarative) sentences are true or false in virtue of the thought believed or said being true or false.</p>\n\n<p>(ii) A thought&nbsp;<em>can be accompanied by the attitude of believing</em>&nbsp;as well as by other acts of persons like entertaining, denying, supposing, etc.</p>\n\n<p>(iii) A thought&nbsp;<em>can be expressed through (declarative) sentences</em>&nbsp;persons can understand and use to say something.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(iv) A thought&nbsp;<em>can be numerically the same across persons and times</em>&nbsp;and hence shared.</p>\n\n<p>(v) A thought&nbsp;<em>consists of various constituents forming a unity</em>&nbsp;truly or falsely representing things as being some way.</p>\n\n<p>What exactly are thoughts or propositions such that they can play these roles? This seminar will take both a historical and a philosophical approach to this question, considering the classic views on thoughts or propositions as they were developed in the period from Early Modern philosophy to Early Analytic philosophy, and then considering how (some of) these classic views have been taken up in various ways in contemporary debate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Among other things, we will discuss the following classic views and questions about the nature of thoughts or propositions: Are they the&nbsp;<em>objects and features</em>&nbsp;(or facts) that are thought through acts of thinking, believing, or saying? If so, what about, say, false or empty thoughts? Or are they rather these&nbsp;<em>acts</em>&nbsp;of thinking, believing, or saying themselves, or more precisely,&nbsp;<em>types</em>&nbsp;of such acts? If so, what kinds of acts are they exactly (judgment? predication? &hellip;?), how can we explain their truth or falsity, and how are such types of acts related to their instances (tokens)? Or, again, are they rather the&nbsp;<em>representational contents</em>&nbsp;of such acts? If so, what exactly are these contents: how do they&nbsp;<em>exist</em>, how do we&nbsp;<em>access</em>&nbsp;them, and how do they&nbsp;<em>represent</em>&nbsp;in a way that is true or false? Are they&nbsp;<em>independent of minded subjects</em>&nbsp;and their abilities and acts of representation or are they somehow&nbsp;<em>dependent on such subjects</em>, abilities, and acts? And is the relevant mind&nbsp;<em>finite</em>&nbsp;(human) or&nbsp;<em>infinite</em>&nbsp;(God)? How exactly do thoughts relate to the (declarative) sentences that express them? Are they&nbsp;<em>sentence-like</em>&nbsp;or maybe even in some sense&nbsp;<em>sentences</em>&nbsp;themselves? If so, what about the fact that sentences seem to have their truth-conditions only contingently, while propositions have their truth-conditions necessarily? Are they perhaps rather (types of)&nbsp;<em>uses</em>&nbsp;of sentences?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The primary readings for the seminar will range from Descartes to Wittgenstein to the present. We will likely focus on the following authors, depending on our progress and interests in the seminar:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- Early Modern Philosophy: Ren&eacute; Descartes, Nicolas Malebranche, Antoine Arnauld, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- Modern Philosophy: Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- Early Analytic Philosophy: Bernard Bolzano, Gottlob Frege, George Edward Moore, Bertrand Russell (early and later), Wittgenstein (Tractatus).</p>\n\n<p>- Contemporary analytic philosophy: Jeffrey King (as taking up and developing early Russell and Wittgenstein), Scott Soames (as taking up and developing later Russell and Wittgenstein), Peter Hanks (as taking up and developing Wittgenstein), Friederike Moltmann (as taking up and developing later Russell), Till Hoeppner (as taking up and developing Kant and Frege).</p>\n\n<p>All readings for the seminar will be made available to participants in electronic form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The readings for the first week are as follows, to be read carefully by the participants in preparation for the sessions:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edition: Ren&eacute; Descartes, <em>Philosophical Essays and Correspondence</em>, Edited, with Introduction, by ROGER ARIEW, Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.

Kantian Themes in Analytic Metaphysics and Philosophy of Mind [PHI-4487] [PHI-4487-1]</h4><div><strong>Faculty Name </strong><div class='cmsDescp'>Till Alexander Guntar Hoeppner [till.hoeppner@ashoka.edu.in] ,Madhav Gupta [madhav.gupta_ug25@ashoka.edu.in] ;</div></div><div><strong>Overview</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>To be taught by Professor Till Hoeppner.</p>\n\n<p>A longer title for this course might have been: &quot;Bodies, Space, Causation, and Objectivity. Humean and Kantian Themes in Analytic Metaphysics and Philosophy of Mind&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This seminar deals with analytic Kantianism, an important tradition within analytic philosophy. This tradition, which properly begins with the work of Peter F. Strawson in the late 1950s and 1960s, establishes a philosophical dialogue that continues to this day between the analytic tradition and the theoretical philosophy of Kant &ndash; especially his&nbsp;<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>&nbsp;&ndash; regarding philosophical problems first formulated and solutions to these problems first attempted by Kant. In this context, other early modern philosophers who were important to Kant, mainly Leibniz and Hume, become part of this dialogue. We will also use passages from Leibniz, Hume, and Kant themselves when it seems helpful to do so. Note that no prior knowledge of Kant is required to participate in the seminar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The focus of the seminar is on theoretical philosophy and lies, more specifically, at the intersection between metaphysics and philosophy of mind. The readings and discussions in the seminar will centre on questions concerning the representational relation of mind to reality. A major recurring theme of the seminar concerns supposedly fundamental features of our representational relation to the world, say, that we represent it as containing or constituted of bodies (individual material things), that we represent these bodies as standing in spatial and causal relations to each other and to us, and that we understand these features as (in some sense or other) objective features of the world. Some Kantian (&lsquo;transcendental&rsquo;) questions that we will discuss are the following: Are these mind-independent features of reality (=realism)? Or do some of them, in some way or the other, depend on minds (=idealism or subjectivism)? Are these facts, say, that we represent the world as containing or constituted of bodies, or these bodies as standing in spatial and causal relations, somehow necessary or indispensable for any objective representation of the world, or could all or some of them have been otherwise? Are there alternative conceptual schemes to the one we use? And if some of these features turn out to be necessary or indispensable, what does that mean? Does it mean that the world really has to be as we represent it because we cannot represent it otherwise, or does it just say something about our representation of the world? &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The seminar&#39;s primary readings range from Strawson to the present. We will focus on major works by four authors &ndash; P. F. Strawson, Barry Stroud, John McDowell, and Tyler Burge &ndash; which will be discussed over several sessions each. Some of these works, parts of which will be studied in detail, are as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- P. F. Strawson&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Individuals. An Essay on Descriptive Metaphysics</em>&nbsp;(London 1959), chapters 1 (Bodies), 2 (Sounds), and 3 (Monads); his&nbsp;<em>The Bounds of Sense. An Essay on the</em>&nbsp;Critique of Pure Reason (London 1966), Parts One (General Review) and Two (Space and Time, Objectivity and Unity, Permanence and Causality); and his&nbsp;<em>Skepticism and Naturalism. Some Varieties</em>, ch. 1 (Skepticism, Naturalism, and Transcendental Arguments), which among other things responds to Stroud&#39;s critique (see below).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- Barry Stroud&#39;s highly influential article &quot;Transcendental Arguments&quot; (The Journal of Philosophy&nbsp;1968) on chapter 1 of Strawson&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Individuals</em>&nbsp;(Bodies); his article &quot;Kantian Argument, Conceptual Capacities, and Invulnerability&quot; (1994), in which he responds to Strawson&#39;s response (see above); and his&nbsp;<em>Engagement and Metaphysical Dissatisfaction. Modality and Value</em>&nbsp;(Oxford 2011), chs. 1 (The Metaphysical Project), 2 (Causation), 5 (Indispensability), and 6 (Metaphysical Dissatisfaction).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- John McDowell&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Mind and World</em>&nbsp;(Harvard 1996), chapters 1 (Concepts and Intuitions), 2 (The Unboundedness of the Conceptual), and 3 (Non-Conceptual Content).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- Tyler Burge&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Origins of Objectivity</em>&nbsp;(Oxford 2010), chs. 1 (Introduction), 2 (Terminology: What the Questions Mean), 3 (Anti-Individualism), and 6 (Neo-Kantian Individual Representationalism: Strawson and Evans).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Beginning with Strawson&#39;s foundational writings, the seminar will trace their reception, development, and critique by subsequent authors, the reception, etc., of those authors&#39; views, and so on. The syllabus will accordingly have an emphasis on philosophical debate and discussion. Thus we will see Stroud objecting to Strawson, who responds; McDowell taking up Strawson&#39;s reading of Kant; Burge discussing what he calls Strawson&#39;s individualism, and so on. Depending on our progress and interests in the seminar, other texts by these four authors and texts by other authors who engage with these four may be discussed: Among others, Gareth Evans on Chapter 2 of Strawson&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Individuals</em>&nbsp;(Sounds) and Strawson&#39;s response; Jay Rosenberg on transcendental arguments in Strawson and Stroud and on sounds in Strawson; Richard Rorty on Strawson on objectivity; Stroud on McDowell on perception; Stroud on McDowell on the Tractarian and supposedly idealistic notion of the world; Stroud on Burge&#39;s anti-individualism and Burge&#39;s response; Thomas Nagel on Stroud on indispensability and objectivity; Anil Gomes on Strawson on objectivity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>All readings from the seminar will be made available in electronic form to seminar participants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The readings for the first week are as follows, to be read carefully by the participants in preparation for the sessions:</p>\n\n<p>- Tuesday, January 21: P. F. Strawson,&nbsp;<em>Individuals. An Essay on Descriptive Metaphysics</em>&nbsp;(Routledge: London/New York 1959), Introduction and Ch. 1, Part 1 (Bodies: The Identification of Particulars).</p>\n\n<p>- Thursday, January 23: P. F. Strawson,&nbsp;<em>Individuals.

Why has religion been addressed, either tacitly or explicitly, in conjunction with magic and science? Are magic, religion and science epochal moments in mankind&rsquo;s evolutionary ascent, or are they coeval in time? How has anthropology, starting with Tylor, Frazer, Durkheim and Malinowski, attempted to come to terms with it? Does the religious history of these European thinkers, with the Reformation as a watershed, have a bearing on why they have been addressed together? Or were they led to invoke the category of magic through a colonial encounter with cultures &ndash; which the New World Encyclopaedia charmingly calls &ldquo;newly contacted societies&#39;&#39; &ndash; that they designated primitive, which in fact is the title &ndash; Primitive Culture &ndash; of Edward Tylor&rsquo;s celebrated work of 1871. The work where Tylor christens such cultures as animistic, thus setting in motion the formal study of religion through the concept of animism: a concept that inaugurates and virtually sets in stone the distinction between Us and Them, or between European and non-European cultures, or between the European past and its present, or between an enchanted, magical, pre-modern and primitive world, and presumably a disenchanted, secular and modern world. It is through the concept of animism, along with its cognate concepts of hylozoism and panpsychism, that this course will trace the genealogy of the study of religion and interrogate its consequences. We will, after running through the canon from Tylor to Evans Pritchard, examine contemporary but &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; ethnographies in &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;polytheistic&rdquo; settings such as Vitebsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dialogues with the Dead&rdquo; in Orissa, or Sax&rsquo;s religion, affliction and healing in the Himalayas. We will then look at Ram&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fertile Disorder&rdquo;, and her &ldquo;provocation of the modern&rdquo;, that extends and attempts to call this trajectory into question. We will pursue this questioning by turning to witchcraft in post-war Germany, and then turn to the fusion of magic, religion and science &ndash; or &ldquo;techno- sacramentalism&rdquo; &ndash; in twenty-first century German Hospitals. We will then, through Keith Thomas&rsquo; work, mark the presumed decline of animism and magic, not in primitive cultures but in European Catholicism, through the assiduous work of the Protestants and their Religion, thus offering us a different vantage point on why animism/magic/superstition were so important to Tylor (a Quaker) and Frazer (a Presbyterian) in framing their theories that the discipline has been historically saddled with. We will end the course by asking &ndash; through the &ldquo;animistic turn&rdquo; and Jason Storm&rsquo;s work &ndash; whether the supposed exit of animism, which presumably inaugurates European modernity and sets it apart from the non-European world, spawning in the bargain ethnographic objects and explanatory moves, is indeed true, and, if not, how are we to rethink the future of not only religion as an object of enquiry, but of our very disciplines and their founding premises?</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Readings<br />\n1.

They are expected to present it in class on a designated day as specified in the Excel Sheet. The class presentation essay must consist of three components:</p>\n\n<p>1) a summary essay of 500 words,</p>\n\n<p>2) a discussion essay of 500 words in which the students may raise questions of the text/authors, relate it to other bodies of work, or offer interpretations/critiques in the light of their personal experience and/or general reading,</p>\n\n<p>3) a 100-word abstract each of the summary essay, and the discussion essay, respectively. In short: 500+500+100+100 = 1200 words. All the components of the class presentation essays must be merged into a single file and uploaded to Google Classroom by Sunday midnight for the Wednesday class, and by Tuesday midnight for the Friday class. It must also be sent to me and the TA/TF on our e-mail IDs. On the designated day of presentation, students must present only the two abstracts (100+100) to the class in 5-8 minutes. This will constitute two credits of the four-credit course. All students are expected to read the assigned texts and the essays written by their classmates prior to the class. The other two credits will be for an end- term essay of 4000-5000 words on a mutually acceptable topic chosen in consultation with me. The in-person class presentation essays, and the end-term essay, are both mandatory.

As a state, it follows centuries of imperial dynasties whose complex legacies it sometimes claims and sometimes rejects. In the last two hundred years, China has experienced some of the most dramatic social and cultural transformations and some of the most violent conflicts of any region of the world. As it was incorporated into an international system dominated by Europe and the United States, it became an integral part of global history in new ways and, increasingly, a shaper of that history. Often imagined as a monolith, it is in fact deeply heterogeneous, home to multiple languages and ethnicities, countless local traditions, millions of adherents of major world religions, and sizable foreign communities. Today, China is the site of crucial questions concerning geopolitics, the environment, global health, and human rights. At the same time, it has inherited and continues to produce immense bodies of art and literature, distinctive belief systems and intellectual movements, and delicious food. In these and other capacities, it also informs the identities of millions of people of Chinese ancestry living around the world.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This course examines the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) and the early days of the Republic of China. It makes reference to Tibetan, Taiwanese, diasporic Chinese, and global histories as well. It offers systematic coverage of Qing expansion and crisis, Qing culture, encounters with Asia and the West, the emergence of nationalism, and the transition out of the dynastic state. In the process, it gives special attention to questions of race and ethnicity, gender, frontiers, global connections, and nation-building. Instead of a chronological overview of the Qing era, this class will deal with historical processes between 1644-1912 through the four themes of statecraft, agriculture and commerce, ethnicity, and gender. This course design emphasizes historical thinking skills (e.g. understanding causation, contingency, agency, anachronism, meaning, and so on) and highlights the voices of historical figures, both powerful and ordinary, through translated primary sources. No prior knowledge is required.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course Objectives</p>\n\n<p>This course has two objectives. One is to develop productive familiarity with some of the most representative themes, questions, and sources associated with the study of Qing history. The other is to cultivate the ability to ask historical questions in an intellectually responsible and rigorous way. We will focus on skills of critical thinking, reading, and writing (including textual, contextual, conceptual, comparative, and synthetic analysis), as well as habits of reasonable, respectful, and inclusive discussion. By the end of this class you should be able to:</p>\n\n<p>Summarize academic monographs in East Asian studies and introduce salient points in notes and in speech.</p>\n\n<p>Draw connections between works to gain an overview of scholarly and historiographical debates in the study of Qing China.</p>\n\n<p>Trace theoretical or methodological trends across multiple empirical contexts.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Required Texts and key:</p>\n\n<p>You are not required to purchase any materials for this course. All readings will be provided in PDF via email. Some weeks will list additional optional material, please reach out to me if you would like a copy of those texts.</p>\n\n<p>In general, the books we are reading from most frequently are:</p>\n\n<p>Morris Rossabi, A History of China, 1st edition (Wiley Blackwell, 2014).

Javier Milei seems to have succeeded in stopping the downward turn of the Argentinian economy by reducing government spending. It is a crucial time to study how markets function and what is the role of government regulation in the functioning of markets. To understand the present, we must revisit the past.</p>\n\n<p>What is capitalism and how do we define markets? How do politics, society, and markets interact with one another? This course is designed to introduce students to theoretical works from prominent intellectual debates in 20th and 21st century political economy that engage with these questions. It examines the interaction between politics, society, and markets, linking theory to current policy debates. It particularly emphasizes the ways in which markets are embedded in social and political institutions.</p>\n\n<p>The course can be broadly divided into two parts. In the first half, we survey some of the most influential works from multiple disciplines, including sociology, political science, economics, history, geography, and law. In this part of the course, we will read the classics &ndash; Smith, Marx, Polyani, and other authors whose perspectives, when juxtaposed next to each other, provide deeper insights into how markets and capitalism are conceived. We review theories of neoliberalism, neo-Marxism, law and political economy, racial capitalism, and feminist economics, among others.</p>\n\n<p>In the second part, we apply theories of political economy to some of the greatest challenges of our time, including inequality, climate change, the Covid-19 pandemic, the rise of big tech, and the tension between capitalism and democracy. In the second part of the course, we will also focus on regions or nation-states (China, India, and Latin America) as well as events that are central to understanding capitalism (fall of the USSR, the 2008 financial crisis)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>To acquire a deeper understanding of how capitalism and markets are imagined across disciplines.

Through an analysis of the current news media landscape they will be able to learn the value of staying true to these tenets.</p>\n\n<p>The classes will be conducted as part lecture, part editorial meeting and part fieldwork. Students are expected to arrive in class having read at least two of the day&rsquo;s major newspapers and scoured through news websites that offer both text and video formats of news.

    "description": "<h4>Though This be Madness: Theories of History-Writing [HIS-5900] [HIS-5900-1]</h4><div><strong>Faculty Name </strong><div class='cmsDescp'>Aparna Vaidik [aparna.vaidik@ashoka.edu.in] ;</div></div><div><strong>Overview</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This graduate seminar&nbsp; is inspired by the famous line in Shakespeare&rsquo;s play Hamlet &lsquo;&ldquo;though this be madness, there is method in&rsquo;t&rdquo;. This line captures the bewildering number of methods that historians have conjured up or drawn on to practice their craft. We will read ten historical texts written over a period of 50 years (from 1960s to 2010s) that engage with historical processes and also conceptualize their method for studying the process. For instance, Robert Darnton&#39;s book on &#39;Mesmerism&#39; examines&nbsp;an exotic theory of healing that&nbsp;immediately seized the imagination of the general populace. Darnton&rsquo;s juxtaposes this to the utter failure of&nbsp;Rousseau&#39;s&nbsp;Social Contract in rousing the masses. The question he asks is: if the greatest political treatise of the age failed to interest many literate Frenchmen, what form of radical ideas&nbsp;suited their tastes? This question serves as a doorway into study of popular culture and, it also questions the general historical assumption that it is the works of big theorists that move&nbsp;history. Paul Feyeraband in his book&nbsp;Against Method&nbsp;takes the example of Galileo to make a case that science should have an anarchic method. He poses the apparently simple but not-so-innocuous question:&nbsp;How does science differ from witchcraft? He demonstrates how&nbsp;Galileo used rhetoric, propaganda, and various epistemological artifices&nbsp; to support the heliocentric position. Agnes Heller, author of&nbsp;A&nbsp;Theory of History&nbsp;conceptualizes the idea of &#39;chance&#39; as a significant element of historical method. She draws on&nbsp;Jules Verne&rsquo;s book Captain Grant&rsquo;s Children (1867), where the children find a bottle in a the belly of a shark. The bottle has a message which is wet and not fully decipherable. They find the lost ship (from which the bottle with the note came) completely by chance and not by&nbsp;piecing together the evidence. Similarly, Marshall Sahlins writes about the significance of &#39;co-incidence&#39; and Carlo Ginzburg about &#39;conjecture&#39; as central element of historical method. I am imagining this seminar as a lively conversation that we will have as we read and engage with these books. The objective is to think deeply about the historian&rsquo;s craft and to understand one&#39;s own practice. Please join the course only if you are willing to read deeply and if you enjoy conversations.</p>\n\n<p>Class Format: Each student is expected to &lsquo;adopt&rsquo; two texts (one before the mid-term and one after) and come prepared to present the main questions the books raise, their arguments, the sources they draw on and the vantage point of the historian, and finally what they made of the text.</p>\n\n<p>The books:</p>\n\n<p>1.

Seneca spoke disparagingly of those who taught us how to argue rather than how to live. For Montaigne, our duty was to compose our characters rather than books. The Buddhist eight-fold path was not a speculation of merely intellectual import, but intended as a guide for the right way to live. The arguments of the&nbsp;Analects&nbsp;were intended to indicate a path towards&nbsp;self-cultivation.&nbsp;In this course, we will study the various ways in which philosophy can be conceived of as a way of life. We will also consider whether such conceptions of philosophy can be valuable, or even defensible, in the twenty-first century. This is a course in comparative philosophy and we will study a range of philosophical traditions to learn&nbsp;how philosophy was &mdash; and can be &mdash; lived.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>A tentative reading list (subject to modification) is as follows:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Yogasutra&nbsp;2.1&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Milinda panha&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Ganeri, &ldquo;Philosophy as a Way of Life: Spiritual Exercises from the Buddha to Tagore&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>Plato,&nbsp;Apology</li>\n\t<li>Hadot,&nbsp;Philosophy as a Way of Life&nbsp;Ch 5</li>\n\t<li>Nehamas,&nbsp;Art of Living&nbsp;Ch 2</li>\n\t<li>Iamblichus,&nbsp;On the Pythagorean Way of Life&nbsp;(selections)</li>\n\t<li>Macris, &ldquo;Pythagorean Spiritual Guidance&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>Buddha,&nbsp;Dhammacakkapavattanasutta&nbsp;(selections)</li>\n\t<li>Epictetus,&nbsp;Discourses&nbsp;(selections)</li>\n\t<li>Kapstein, &ldquo;Stoics and Boddhisattvas&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>Seneca, &ldquo;On the shortness of life&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>Chandrakirti,&nbsp;Advice to Travellers on the Bodhisattva Path&nbsp;(selections)</li>\n\t<li>Ganeri, &ldquo;A Return to the Self: Indians and Greeks on Life as Art and Philosophical Therapy</li>\n\t<li>Kong Zi,&nbsp;Analects&nbsp;(selections)</li>\n\t<li>Laozi,&nbsp;Daodejing&nbsp;(selections), &ldquo;An Exhortation to Learning,&rdquo;&ldquo;Cultivating Yourself&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>Zhuangzi, &ldquo;Free and Easy Wandering&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>Mulla Sadra,&nbsp;Four Journeys</li>\n\t<li>Rizvi, &ldquo;Approaching Islamic Philosophical Texts&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>Schopenhauer, &ldquo;On the Sufferings of the World&rdquo; and &ldquo;On the Vanity of Existence&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>Montaigne,&nbsp;Essays&nbsp;(preface, selections)</li>\n\t<li>Selections from the writings of MK Gandhi</li>\n\t<li>Bilgrami, &ldquo;Gandhi as Philosopher&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n </div></div>",

But is that all we do with language? In this course we will examine language as a dynamic social phenomenon, fully embedded in the world of human activity. Language emerges, is maintained, and changes through its use, but language also shapes and alters the very social world it is part of. We must look at language&nbsp;in use,&nbsp;empirically, in order to understand how this works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To do so, we will learn and use the tools of linguistic and semiotic anthropology in order to carefully question: what is language? How do we draw lines between languages? How does language function in society? How does it shape politics, history, literature? We will be concerned with classic questions posed in the empirical study of language, from the seeming stability of &ldquo;codes&rdquo; versus their dynamism and change; modes of interaction and communication; language ideologies and language differentiation; referentiality and indexicality; register formation and social value. We will also approach questions around multilingualism, language politics, and &ldquo;mother tongue,&rdquo;&nbsp; as well as any other topics pertaining to the research of the course participants (in any discipline). As we will see, language is always political, and questions about politics (and history, and literature, and society in general) are&nbsp;always&nbsp;also questions about language.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course is intended for interested graduate students in any discipline and advanced undergraduates with permission of the professor. No previous training in linguistic anthropology is necessary &mdash; we will build our technical&nbsp;vocabulary and repertoire of concepts from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

It discusses the making of Ottoman political sovereignty and economy in the early modern period in the backdrop of the many challenges faced by the Empire.</p>\n\n<p>The course has a comparative edge, and encourages us to think about the deep cultural and intellectual affinities that the Ottoman empire had with the Mughals and the Safavids in India and Iran respectively.

The courses are designed particularly to equip PhD students in reading and interpreting historical texts for their research.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Classical Persian Texts and Contexts</strong><br />\nPersian literature written before the nineteenth century differs from modern literature both in form and content. The language of classical Persian literature is replete with Arabic words and literary phrases. They also have rich literary embellishments and artistic expressions. All this makes these texts very different from modern Persian texts. This course introduces these classical Persian texts to the students. It trains them to analyse these texts from a literary point of view and to enhance their skill of reading them in their historical contexts. This course will help the students negotiate the texts, documents, and archival materials of medieval and early modern periods in their PhD research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />\n<strong>Codicology</strong><br />\nMuseums, libraries, and archives are full of Persian manuscripts and documents which are treasure houses of information and knowledge about the past. These Persian texts were written in various scripts by scribes, artists, statesmen, poets, and writers. Aside from texts, there are also additional documentary material &ndash; like flyleaf, colophon, endorsements, and seals &ndash; that are useful to understand the past. Many of these texts are not legible and can be read only by experienced readers. One of the challenges of modern times is to discern these writings and make the texts legible and translate them into English or vernacular languages. Many of the manuscripts lying in archival collection are still waiting for their readers, editors, and translators. As such, they are hidden from the public domain. This course on codicology will train research students in reading these manuscripts and using them for historical and literary research.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Inscriptions</strong><br />\nIn medieval India, the usage of Persian language was not limited to the writings of administrative documents and literature; it was also used to write inscriptions on walls of forts, tablets of mosques, tombs, and gardens. Inscriptions in Persian language also adorned many swords, knives, armours, and cannons.&nbsp; Coins minted by the rulers also bear inscriptions in Persian. Museums and archives have vast collections of such coins and artifacts. All these inscriptions comprise extremely valuable sources for historical research and can be read only by trained scholars. This course equips research students to read and interpret inscriptional records to decode the past.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course enables PhD students of History to read and understand the Persian sources</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Relevant Persian Manuscripts and sources to be used by the PhD students in their researches shall be taught in the classes.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div>",

A majority of SaaS (Software as a Service) applications are being deployed on public clouds owing to numerous benefits they offer &ndash; reduction in operational and deployment overheads, and a seemingly better economic model.</p>\n\n<p>The number of public cloud providers is increasing (AWS, GCP, Azure etc.), with each provider offering an even larger number of services starting from barebones, but configurable VMs to serverless (Function as a Service, FaaS) computing offerings all the way to highly available, managed relational databases and data lakes. Public clouds have created an entirely new economic model where users are charged explicitly for every component of the computer system they use &ndash;&nbsp; storage and memory costs (charged per GiB), compute costs (charged per vCPU and its &ldquo;type&rdquo;) and network inflow and outflow traffic, among many other such a la carte charges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course will be divided into two parts. The first part will be an introduction to the&nbsp; foundational technologies that have made public clouds possible. We will discuss topics both at the hardware and the system software level, starting with the basics of warehouse scale computing, the design and deployment of large scale datacenters and the innovations in CPU, memory, storage and network architectures. Next, we will discuss system software technologies like virtualization, containerization and software defined networking, which in conjunction with hardware innovations like IOMMUs have allowed physical resources to be efficiently shared across multiple tenants while maintaining performance.</p>\n\n<p>In the second part of the course, we will build on these foundations to discuss the major components of developing SaaS applications and the various tradeoffs that software architects have to consider while designing and developing these apps for scaling up. Typical tradeoffs include choice of the technology stack, deciding whether to create an application as a monolith or a collection of microservices, incorporating high availability and high performance into application design and use of caching and tiering in application design. We will also discuss the various security considerations and the reasons why application developers must pay attention to them right from the start, rather than an afterthought. Finally, we will discuss data management, data lifecycle, data security of applications: the various factors that application developers should be cognizant of while designing and deploying applications to ensure data safety and integrity.</p>\n\n<p>The tentative, and possibly exhaustive list of topics to be covered in the course is below. The list will be revised with exact topics closer to the start of the semester.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Basics of Cloud Infrastructure and networking, Virtualization and Containers, Datacenter server architectures</p>\n\n<p>Deployment architectures: Monoliths vs. Microservices</p>\n\n<p>Application deployment considerations: N-tier architectures; Load Balancers, Application and Caching layers, Data management layers</p>\n\n<p>Data management basics: ACID properties; Consistency; transactions in DB architectures; Schema Design and optimization; query construction and optimization; Replication / Sharding and when to use them</p>\n\n<p>Data management layer: Choice of Relational vs. NoSQL options; In Memory DBs and Caching; Fine tuning existing DBs for performance&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Fault-tolerance and High Availability: Basic concepts, Implementations by Cloud providers</p>\n\n<p>Application monitoring and alerting: Basics of observability; what to monitor, when to alert; Application logging for performance and debugging</p>\n\n<p>Security considerations: DDoS prevention, firewalls; Basic security measures for all deployments: port scanning, internal and external IP addresses, tunneling, consideration of performance overheads due to security.</p>\n\n<p>Basics of Cloud Economics: Understanding cloud billing; performance / dollar for your application.</p>\n\n<p>Implications of privacy laws (GDPR e.g.) on application design and deployment; Reading and Understanding DPAs.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><ul>\n\t<li>Understanding of basic technologies that make public clouds possible</li>\n\t<li>Aspects of deploying software in public clouds</li>\n\t<li>Hands on experience with deploying applications in/for public clouds.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course Prerequisites:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Computer Organization and Architecture,</li>\n\t<li>Operating Systems,</li>\n\t<li>Computer Networks,&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Familiarity with tools like Git, Docker, Shell scripting</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or equivalent of the above courses, if you are a PG/PhD student.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>This will be taught as a 6 week course, with classes being held every alternate week.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students will be organized into teams.

This course is a virtual journey across the world, to study, view, and curate films that have made an impact globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course examines key theoretical and critical concepts, as well as debates, that are essential for a comprehensive historical and contextual understanding of World Cinema. It emphasizes contemporary developments and case studies through specific films, regions, and/or directors. The current period is widely regarded by critics as a golden age for emerging &quot;new cinemas,&quot; directors, and transnational trends, including popular exportable genres, new multicultural genres like migrant and accented cinema, &quot;new&quot; realisms, and &quot;slow cinema.&quot; Recently, World Cinema Studies and Transnational Film Studies have emerged as distinct academic fields. The aim of this course is to provide you with a well-rounded understanding of the diverse range of World Cinemas beyond the structures of&nbsp;Hollywood, exploring the transnational and transcultural contexts of production, circulation, consumption, and reception of &quot;World Cinema&quot; films today. These aspects have been shaped by factors such as new digital technologies, the internet, global media convergence, economic and cultural globalization, and political transformations, all of which will be addressed in this&nbsp;course. Alongside a theoretical and analytical component, the course will also introduce you to practical notions of curatorship, to&nbsp; understand how the exhibition industry works in relation to creative programmes of world cinema. Some of the key films we will study are from regions such as Africa, Italy, Iran, Korea, and China, among others.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>On completion of this course, students will be able to</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>1. Gain an understanding of key theoretical and critical concepts, models and debates relevant to the study of both national cinemas and transnational developments within World Cinemas, and had opportunities to apply these. (Research Dossier, Curatorial programme, and audio-visual diary).</p>\n\n<p>2. Engage in depth with selected film/cinema case studies (national, transnational, thematic/issue based, or director-focused). (Research Dossier and Curatorial programme).</p>\n\n<p>3. Gain an informed sense of the institutional, economic, political, cultural and wider contextual issues around contemporary &lsquo;World&rsquo; filmmaking (from questions of history, identity and representation to the impacts of globalisation and new technologies) and the ways in which these may shape the themes, style, production, circulation and reception of non-Hollywood &lsquo;World Cinema&rsquo; films. (Research Dossier and Curatorial Programme).</p>\n\n<p>4. Build competence in, selecting and applying relevant concepts, arguments and contextual understanding appropriately in (i) discussion and evaluation of trends, movements and/or case studies within World Cinema at national and transnational levels, and (ii) critical discussion and/or textual analysis of specific films. (Research Dossier and Curatorial programme).</p>\n\n<p>5. Demonstrate a critical, practical and historically informed appreciation of the different ways in which film industries may be conceptualised in both national and transnational terms.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><span style=\"color:#3498db;\"><strong>Week 1:&nbsp;The Concept of National Cinema </strong></span></p>\n\n<p>READING: S.

This magical gift is something that&#39;s made up to fill the gaps left by lack of interest and experience, perpetuated by inconsistent instruction and practice, and propagated by the fortunate few who find it easier to say you lack the spark rather than admit how much more important social networking and societal connections are compared to raw talent.<br />\n<br />\nWhat does exist, however, is a way to understand how to develop your interest and skill in visual art through artistic techniques, deliberate practice, and iterative improvement. We will practice these techniques over the classes, learn from artists before us, and create a distinctive artistic language. We will learn through a mix of drawing &amp; painting, films, photography, and experiential exercises.<br />\n<br />\nThis course is for anyone that has wanted to take up visual art but felt constrained by a perceived lack of creativity (which isn&#39;t real) - but it will serve just as well for artists that find themselves at impasses, and even those who just want to refresh their creative energies (again, not real). &quot;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The criteria for grading are the following: attendance, participation in class, and a creative project/ assignment determined by the Professor.

In this course we will review historical sources that first established the Indian roots of these people&mdash;now called &lsquo;Roma&rsquo;&mdash;and explore how the Romani language evolved over a millennium as its speakers passed through various way stations, adopting &lsquo;loan words&rsquo; from other languages encountered en route. The Romani language in turn also influenced and enriched the languages it came in contact with. Through root-recognition activities, we will investigate if Romani is comprehensible to present-day speakers of particular Indian languages. Through songs, stories and cinema, we will experience the sound, structure and expressivity of Romani and observe how it has been used to convey identity, community values and resilience, despite historical persecution and marginalization of the Roma. We will also discuss the diversity of dialects, the challenges posed to linguistic unity, and modern efforts to preserve and revitalize the Romani language and keep it alive for future generations.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The criteria for grading are the following: attendance, participation in class, and a creative project/ assignment determined by the Professor.

But are not the compositions of Jayadeva, for instance, also ghazals, not in their literary structure but in their emotional and musical thrust? So we will learn music that might not have clear historical connections but surprisingly share the same motifs of love. Indeed, the braiding of the devotional and the erotic in the ghazal allows us to ask questions about forms of music like the Karnatik that are only framed as projects of bhakti. As we add new compositions to our repertoire, dipping into different genres and thinking of their lyrical resonances, we will attend to the musical movements that might themselves be considered gestures of longing&mdash;of lament, of depression, of stasis, of relief, of agony, an anxiety, the many states of love.

Their utilities have been enhanced by their ability to generate massive amount of transactional data that are accurately stored, efficiently verified and rapidly disseminated. But, these information-asymmetric private data have been frequently misused. For instance, the World Wide Web, Distributed Ledgers, GPT/genAI and Personal Data Markets enable information flows among vast number of humans; facebook, LinkedIn, etc. connect small groups of friends, colleagues and acquaintances; amazon, ebay, etc. provide opportunities for trading; uber, airbNb, etc. create platforms for sharing economy; silkroad, agora, etc., create systems for anonymous and often illicit trading, etc. These networks determine our information, influence our opinions, and shape our political attitudes. They also link us, often through important but weak ties, to other humans. Their origin is biological: going back to quorum-sensing, swarming, flocking, social grooming, gossiping, etc. Yet, as we have connected our social networks to traditional human institutions (markets, justice systems, education, etc.) through new technologies, the underlying biology has become obscured, but not dormant.</p>\n\n<p>We will select Use Cases of interest to the audience to design a new environment ab initio.</p>\n\n<p>Motivation&nbsp;We are motivated by the following goals:</p>\n\n<p>Understand the evolving environment (e.g., wealth management and investment banking services)</p>\n\n<p>Model utilities and risks (robust hypotheses, driving rapid and scalable testing and learning: e.g., A/B testing, boosting and reinforcement learning, hallucination and guardrails)</p>\n\n<p>Interact strategically and rationally (use case development, hypothesis testing and production of new value for clients and the firm within and across divisions)</p>\n\n<p>Design mechanisms such that all stake-holders interact strategically but in a mutually beneficial manners (&quot;good&quot; Nash equilibria; Shapely values, &quot;Cellularization&quot;)</p>\n\n<p>Topics</p>\n\n<p>[Introduction to Networks] (Biological, Social, Economic and Communication):&nbsp;where we study important binary relationships (e.g., friendship, followership, P2P, B2B, etc.) among entities: such as users, objects, contents.

The earliest accounts of politics- that is war - were recorded in these epics and poems. They were composed to project heroes, create myths and engage with ideas of right and wrong, life and death and the mundane and the transcendent. Poetry has also always been used to dissent, protest, critique and resist. From the anti-legalist poetry of Attar and Rumi to the anti-establishment poems by Percy Bysshe Shelley, Habib Jalib and Maya Angelou, poets have taken considerable risk to be the voice of the voiceless.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unafraid of speaking truth to power, they have been censored, banished, imprisoned and even killed. The power of the spoken word is even acknowledged by kings, potentates, tyrants and leaders who sought to project themselves as poets: Mao published 18 poems in the inaugural issue of a journal called Shih-k&rsquo;an, Saddam Hussain wrote poetry towards the end of his time in prison, often sharing it with his guards, and&nbsp;Radovan Karadžić&rsquo;s poetry was seen by some as tantamount to war crimes. Rulers and states have always been wary of poets.&nbsp;Plato envisaged a republic in which certain poets would be banished if they did not write the &lsquo;right&rsquo; kind of poetry, with poetry being closely related to song, drama and performance as well. The Quran emphatically states that the Prophet was not a poet and then warns believers against poets &lsquo;except those&nbsp;who believe, do good, remember Allah often, and&nbsp;˹poetically˺&nbsp;avenge&nbsp;˹the believers˺&nbsp;after being wrongfully slandered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The function of poetry has been varied. Poetry can soothe or provoke, give hope, arouse anger, agitate or calm, bind otherwise diverse people, instil courage and importantly ask questions while creating the possibilities of multiple answers. Poetry has been every(wo)man&rsquo;s philosophy, a portal to the sacred and a medium for the profane, poets have become the sloganeers of revolutions and their poems have shaken the thrones of tyrants. Adorno said that to write poetry after Auschwitz would be barbaric. Refaat Al-Areer&nbsp;&nbsp;wrote &lsquo;If I must die&rsquo; in 2011 while living under occupation and shortly before he was killed in Gaza, almost presciently, he reshared his poem.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;In this course we will read about what makes poetry so powerful: its forms and cadences, meters, sonic and phonic aspects, silences, uses of images and metaphors, its power to articulate what is felt in novel and arresting ways and of course its spaces. We will therefore also study the work of poets from different ages and parts of the world whose poetry was marked by protest and dissent. While one part of the course will be structured in order to equip ourselves with the tools to understand the broader theoretical frameworks of poetry, the other part will be the consequence of us choosing which poets and case studies we seek understand.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

There is a growing and diverse flow of goods, capital, people and ideas moving across India&rsquo;s territorial borders amidst an uncertain, fractious geopolitical order. India&rsquo;s foreign economic and security policies are also assuming electoral salience at home, as well as a growing extra-territorial dimension, including a 30-million strong diaspora. India now aims to be a &ldquo;voice of the Global South,&rdquo; reform multilateral institutions and host the 2036 Olympics. Whether it is artificial intelligence, health, outer space or the Internet, Indian officials are now increasingly involved &ndash; or expected to be present -- at the global &ldquo;high tables&rdquo; setting new global standards and regulations. This increasingly complex, fast-paced international environment is posing new challenges for India to define and pursue its interests abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Yet while we know much about the rising ambition, expanding scope and accelerating pace of India&rsquo;s international engagements in recent years, there is less knowledge about the growing number of institutions, sites and forces that shape its foreign policy behaviour. This course introduces students to the broader yet also less visible ecosystem in which Indian foreign policy is made or &ldquo;begins&rdquo; at home: What traditional and new organizations are involved in defining India&rsquo;s international posture? What are the main institutional sites and locations of decision-making, at different levels of government and across the country, from New Delhi to border regions? How do different domestic, non-governmental forces and actors shape the ideas and interests that drive India&rsquo;s international engagements?</p>\n\n<p>The course is divided in two parts, focused on specialized readings, class discussions and different types of oral and written assignments to map the&nbsp;different&nbsp;institutions, sites and forces that&nbsp;shape the India way of diplomacy. The first part explores the traditional, state-centric perspective including the role of different ministries and the bureaucracy, the armed forces, intelligence organizations, the parliament and regional states. The second part examines the non-state perspective, including the role of political parties, the private sector, civil society organizations, media and think tanks.</p>\n\n<p>By tracking these different levels of analysis, focused on case studies across time and space, we&nbsp; will also assess how this environment has changed in recent years, reflecting issues of Indian state capacity, policy coordination, organizational change and accountability that are rarely studied in Indian IR. This will help students to a) familiarize themselves with both old and new institutions, sites and forces that are shaping Indian foreign policy, b) connect (or apply) theoretical concepts and learnings from foreign policy analysis, international political economy and historical institutionalism to the case of India, and c) develop insights and analytical skills that are required for most public policy professionals focused on India.</p>\n</div></div>",

While the idea of the digital may be used to refer to binary connections, the computational, electronic, or anything that is internet mediated, ethnographers are interested in the imbrications of these technologies in everyday life and the consequences of the digital for the human condition- in online worlds and in their entanglements with lived realities in physical places. Ethnographic approaches in other words help us explore human interactions with digital devices, the making of human connections in cyberspace, coproduction of notions of the real and the virtual, or the conditions of living and being in a digital culture- that might be called `digitality&rsquo;. We will examine possibilities of these human engagements in diverse sites and contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course will be taught over three sections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We first chart some of the conceptual dilemmas in the terrain. How do we approach understandings of `digitality&rsquo;? In what ways may the digital mediate human life and culture? Are they any different from prior mediations?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The second section engages with methodological contestations that ethnographers of digital media grapple with. These include existent questions of power, subjectivity, or reflexivity in ethnography in general, but also those that address specific dilemmas in digital ethnography. What does it mean to do ethnography in digital worlds? What may be its analytic advantage to study sociality or politics? Can virtual worlds be studied on their own terms- without ethnographic engagement in the physical worlds that actors in digital places also belong to? What does it mean to conduct multi-sited or multi-timed fieldwork on specific congeries of media practices, forms and agents? How does ethnography help us approach closer towards understandings of digital media in everyday life that is &lsquo;non-media-centric&rsquo;? Can the study of media beyond media content, as part of the sensory, embodied and affective routines of everyday life, help us arrive at thicker understandings of the possible role of media in social life and change?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we engage with a range of ethnographic studies of lived histories and vernacular cultures of digital media, exploring local meanings to digital genres of work,&nbsp;gaming, dating, memes, blogging, or hacking for instance, but also their intersections with existing cultures of class, difference, disability, gender and sexuality etc.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students will acquire a theoretical grasp and methodological acquaintance with:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1. Digitality and its (ethnographic) Dilemmas&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2. Ethnography in/ of Virtual Worlds&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3. Ethnographic Contexts&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Your grade in the course depends on your consistent commitment to complete required readings every week, critically reflect on them, participate in class discussions, and thoughtfully integrate these insights in your short assignments, midterm paper, and final project. The reading selections for each week may range between 75 and 100 pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Grading will be based on:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Class participation </strong>(15):&nbsp;Students are expected to attend classes regularly, complete assigned readings and contribute to discussions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Two short assignments</strong> (2.5 + 7.5):&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first short assignment (2.5 points)&nbsp;is to introduce yourself in about 250 words. What is your academic background and what have been your recent reading/ viewing interests? What interests you about the world? What do you hope to get out of this course? Your first assignment which helps me get to know you has a turn it in grade and&nbsp;should be uploaded on GC before the first class, latest by 5 PM on&nbsp;January 20.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The second short assignment (7.5 points)&nbsp;is a (single) discussion board post. Students will submit a critical review/ reflection on Google Classroom of the assigned readings for the section they sign up for (an online form will be circulated by the course TA). The discussion board post will not exceed 500 words. Discussion board posts are due by&nbsp;5pm on the day before class,&nbsp;so as to allow adequate time for everyone to read them. You may choose key points that strike you in the readings (make sure that you engage with MOST if not all of the readings for those weeks) and discuss them in relation to broader course themes. Please read the posts of your peers who have signed up on the day before attending class, as they will likely be a starting point for class discussions which your group will anchor. Posts will be submitted/ discussed in batches at the end of weeks&nbsp;3, 5, 7, 9, 11.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Midterm examination</strong> (25%):&nbsp;The mid-term assessment will be a take home overnight examination where you will answer a prompt that will be put up on Google classroom. The question will test your understanding of concepts discussed in class and ability to use/ relate them with/ in emperical contexts. Answer scripts should be uploaded on GC in both word and PDF format by the mentioned deadline.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Digital Ethnography Project</strong> (50%):&nbsp;Project grade will be based on components of (provisional) proposal, theoretical care, ethnographic rigor (to be discussed in tutorial discussions), final project and presentation. Ethnographic location in virtual/ physical worlds/ both- is open, as is the subject of inquiry. Your final project report should be uploaded on GC in word and PDF format by the given deadline, with links to other materials you wish me to view.</p>\n </div></div>",

We will talk mainly about the pricing assets in the equity market, but later, we will also discuss options (puts &amp; calls). The course revolves around different models, methods, and approaches that&nbsp;might&nbsp;help us identify mispriced financial assets, which could&nbsp;help us design a reasonably good portfolio. These methods and models have some economic or accounting rationale behind&nbsp;them, and some are based on groundbreaking papers published in the last century. Despite all that, a student in this course would eventually realize that no one model/ method is enough to help us understand the true value of a financial asset. In fact, it is extremely hard to explain why a given object has a particular value and check whether that object is overpriced/ underpriced. Renowned statistician George Box once said - &quot;all models are wrong, but some are useful.&quot; That is what we will try to do in this course - study some models that have been useful in the context of asset pricing. To be specific, we will start with a modern interpretation of Talmudic investing strategy, Markowitz portfolio selection (and maybe some of the later&nbsp;variants if time or your interest permits), factor/ index models, capital asset pricing model (CAPM), and its variants, arbitrage pricing theory, Fama-French three-factor model (maybe briefly discuss the more recent 5-factor model), efficient market hypothesis, equity valuation models, and later we will study options, put-call parity, Black-Scholes&#39; options pricing.<br />\n<br />\nThis is a rigorous course, a math- and statistics-based course. If such things tire you, if you are looking for a storytelling,&nbsp;case studies-based approach, or <em>only</em>&nbsp;a DCF-based approach, then this course is probably not for you.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>\n\n<p>ECO 2400 (Econometrics) or MAT 2020 (Probability and Statistics)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>This course is open to:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>All 3rd-year ECO/ ECOFIN majors</li>\n\t<li>All Math majors at 4000-level</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Midterm 1: 20% weightage<br />\nMidterm 2: 20% weightage<br />\nPop Quizzes&nbsp;and/ or Data Exercises: 15% weightage (7% for quizzes, 8% for data exercises)<br />\nFinal Exam: 35% weightage<br />\nParticipation (including attendance): 10% weightage</p>\n\n<p><strong>The syllabus for the Final Exam will be cumulative</strong></p>\n\n<p>There will be no makeup midterm or pop quizzes.&nbsp;If your score on the Final Exam is better than your lowest midterm, I&nbsp;am willing to drop your lowest midterm and scale up the score on the final exam by a factor of (35+20)/35 = 1.571 (approx).

Initially a Silicon Valley phenomenon, the growing importance of product management &ndash; a cross functional discipline which comprises of a deep focus on customers and design, emphasizes the centrality of data in making decisions and the importance of keeping abreast of evolving technological and market dynamics, and utilizes business metrics to evaluate the success of technological innovations &ndash; now means that product managers can be found in firms across sectors and industries. The product function is hence a critical differentiator that determines whether a technology product satisfies user needs in a seamless way, ensuring rapid adoption by customers, or becomes a hindrance towards achieving business goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This product management course will teach important skills necessary to be an effective product manager and build, launch, and grow successful digital products.

Spanning 26 sessions and worth 4 credits, the course is<br />\nstructured into four comprehensive modules that cover a wide range of investment<br />\ntopics and strategies.<br />\nThe course content begins with an introduction to various investment options,<br />\nincluding deposits, debt, equity, private equity, real estate, mutual funds, and<br />\ncommodities. Students will learn to evaluate the relevance and potential payoffs<br />\nassociated with different asset classes while understanding the psychological factors<br />\nthat influence investment decisions. Key financial concepts such as the time value of&nbsp;money and discounted cash flows are introduced early on, providing a solid<br />\nfoundation for further study. Additionally, students engage in practical exercises,<br />\nincluding asset allocation strategies and stock-picking frameworks, enhancing their<br />\nanalytical skills in real-world contexts.<br />\nThe students will go through an intensive checklist and learn different tests to<br />\nevaluate stocks. These include, but are not limited to, the macro test, value test,<br />\ngrowth test, profitability test, timing and transaction strategy, and over 25 other<br />\nconsiderations in the market. Students will not only learn various parameters and<br />\nhow to apply different tests to stocks, but they will also build assumptions and learn<br />\nhow to forecast the parameters in these tests.<br />\nThis course is applicable in numerous settings, from personal finance management to<br />\ncorporate investment strategies. Students will develop critical skills such as risk<br />\nassessment, valuation techniques, and behavioral finance insights. These skills are<br />\nessential for making informed investment decisions and understanding market<br />\ndynamics. Furthermore, the course emphasizes the importance of macroeconomic<br />\nfactors and government policies on investment returns, equipping students with a<br />\nholistic view of the investing landscape.<br />\nIndustry relevance is a core aspect of this course.

An example of this is algorithmic trading where an algorithm uses trading data to determine when you should buy or sell a stock in the market. It becomes more interesting when the income tax department assesses a lot of data about individual taxpayers and determines that some of the citizens are not paying enough in taxes. The third example is based on the idea of who should be given a credit card. Most people who have high savings qualify for a credit card but what about those people who have low to medium savings? What about students at Ashoka?</p>\n\n<p>Many of these decisions in finance, such as selling a stock, obtaining a credit card, and identifying defaulters, are based on technology, mathematical algorithms, and knowledge of finance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course starts with a brief understanding of markets and data that we can obtain for these markets. Then we look at how to use this data to decide if we should buy or sell a stock or bond. After having evaluated it heuristically, we try to explore algorithms that can fit the behaviour of the data and perhaps indicate the buy and sell decision.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we apply this broad principle of identifying the data, examining it, and then determining which model should be fitted to different problems in finance including predicting stock price, detecting fraud, providing credit, pricing options, and sizing of companies based on financial attributes.</p>\n\n<p>Companies worldwide are looking for talented people who can understand different parts of finance and apply the right tools and techniques to analyse the products, customers, and services. A person who masters these fields can work for large companies, set up their own start-up, trade in the markets, pursue a career in research, become a financial consultant, and pursue many more opportunities than what is mentioned here.

In doing so, it considers how evolving ideals of manliness came to inform kingship and domesticity in the Sultanate and the Mughal period. To what extent was the courtly and domestic spaces segregated? What were the ways in which the royal women responded and negotiated with the prescribed norms and participate in politics and court society ? How had art and architectural productions served as sites of gendered patronage, aesthetics, labour and performance ? These are some of the questions that we will address in this course. The course will also explore the non-royal social and political groups, the concubines, dancing girls, women slaves and labourers as well as the gender-liminal figure of the eunuch. The processes of gender marginalisation and defiance of gender normativity will also be taken up, particularly through a study of some of the women saints who challenged societal hierarchies in their pursuit of spirituality.

In the process, the course will introduce the students to a dynamic&nbsp; multilingual world where linguistic-literary groups and forms existed in constant circulation and interaction with one another, and historical narratives encompassed multiplicity of languages and literary genres. As case in point, the course will take up several literary and language traditions, notably the &lsquo;courtly&rsquo; languages of Persian and Sanskrit, along with Marathi, Bengali, Brajbhasha and other vernaculars, which had all flourished in tandem with the political culture of the medieval-early modern period. To what extent did these literary narratives inform the formulation of regional, ethnic and devotional identities? Who were the scribes and the poets? How did the material medium of paper facilitate this literary flourish? These are some of the questions that this course will address.

The term subjective&nbsp;well-being (SWB) refers to people&amp;#39;s evaluations of their lives including cognitive judgments&nbsp;such as life satisfaction and affective evaluations (moods and emotions) such as positive and&nbsp;negative emotional feelings. People are said to have high SWB if satisfied with their life and&nbsp;experience frequent positive and infrequent negative emotions.<br />\nIn this age of rapid transformation, societies are changing and there is chaos. A person otherwise&nbsp;very efficient and capable can suffer a breakdown in the absence of handling himself or herself&nbsp;psychologically. It is about individual well-being. Understanding this concept can be very&nbsp;beneficial for leading a rewarding life in every sphere of an individual&amp;#39;s life, both internal and&nbsp;external. The understanding of well-being/happiness (used synonymously) can be a key&nbsp;differentiator towards leading a rewarding life in every sphere of an individual&amp;#39;s life.

This course attempts to unpack such an &ldquo;Image of Africa&rdquo;, as Chinua Achebe famously described it, through a closer examination of African literary modernities and the larger colonial and postcolonial histories of African nations around the time of their formations as independent sovereign states. Focusing primarily on the novel as a marker of and vehicle for the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; in African literary cultures, with the example of writers such as Ayi Kwei Armah, Assia Djebar, Camara Laye and Ama Ata Aidoo, we will be working towards understanding the experiential pluralities of colonization and postcoloniality that underscore African literary modernities.&quot;</p>\n</div></div>",

At the same time, unmodern or retrograde institutions and practices, such as the caste system or communal politics, are assumed to be culturally and historically embedded in South Asian thought and practice unrelated to the expansion of the Empire and colonial conquest. The underlying assumption of all this being that modern emancipatory and universal ideas originated in the West &ndash; the Enlightenment being the well-spring of these modern universals. As such, when the non-West or the so-called global south is engaged within such contexts it is either to retrieve &ldquo;raw data&rdquo; or practices which maybe contrasted to the (Western) universals as &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; ideas and practices, or to point out the &ldquo;degraded&rdquo; versions of&nbsp; the &ldquo;original&rdquo; ideas and institutions of the West.</p>\n\n<p>The burgeoning field of global history however seeks to highlight the relational constitution of the modern world by unearthing global entanglements of ideas, institutions, people, and things. It points out how even European universals were shaped as a result of the colonial encounter. While global history highlights the interconnected nature of the modern world, comparative social and political theory challenges the dominant assumption that concept-formation and theory-building is exclusively the remit of Western political theory. In short, universalizable ideas and ideals can also be found in non-western thought. Comparative theory, or &ldquo;theory from the global south&rdquo; therefore draws attention to non-western thought, such as in South Asia, Africa, China, and Latin America, and shows how socio-political actors in the global south or in post-colonial societies did not simply inherit ideas and institutions as derivative of the West. Rather, it was not only that the non-Western world actively engaged with canonical ideas and practices and in that process reshaped or rejected them but also that universal ideas and ideals emerged in relation to and in the context of colonialism and conquest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With a focus on modern South Asia, this course brings together insights from global history and political theory from the global south to not only demonstrate the co-constitutive nature of ideas, concepts, institutions and practices but also retrieve forgotten or recessed emancipatory ideas and practices of the non-western world, which were marginalised as a result of the expansion of the empire and colonial domination in the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, and the emergence of a new world order in the twentieth century based on the model of the Westphalian system of states. We will begin with an examination of liberalism&rsquo;s relationship to the Empire and colonialism, then look at subject-formation in the context of colonialism, the emergence of the modern state, nationalism, and civil society, and finally look at the effects of such modern ideas and institutions on traditional social formations, such as caste and patriarchy. Students are expected to read approx. 80-100 pages per week as preparatory readings.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><u>Please note:</u> Regarding prerequisites, a background in Introduction to Political Theory or related courses is desired but not necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Required Readings, Background Readings, and Suggested Readings</strong></p>\n\n<p>For this course it is highly recommended (but not necessary) that you have basic knowledge of political theory, especially aspects relating to nationalism, state, power, democracy, and civil society, as well as a basic understanding of theories of Liberalism (like, Locke, Mill, Rousseau etc.), Marxism, and Feminism. In the syllabus, apart from the required readings, I have also mentioned, where needed, &ldquo;background readings,&rdquo; in order to give you an idea of the kind of theoretical knowledge you are expected to have. We will discuss some of these background readings (where necessary) but these readings are NOT formally part of the syllabus and therefore you are not expected to read them. Similarly, the suggested readings are also not part of the syllabus but may help you to think through issues that we will discuss in this course.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Class participation (attendance + participation) is going to count for 20% of your final grade. A class presentation, done jointly or in small teams, will count for 10% of your final grade. The presentation will be graded by peers present in class. The details of this will be explained in class. Apart from this, you will have a mid-term take home exam in the form of an essay that will count for 30% of your final grade. Your final take-home exam, also in the form of an essay, will count 40% of your grade. The mid-term essay should be 1800 words and the final essay should be 2800 words. All assignments should be submitted as pdf. File and double-spaced using Times New Roman font with font size 12 for text.</p>\n\n<p>The conversion of marks into letter grades follows the standard Ashoka policy (https://ashoka.edu.in/static/doc_uploads/file_1492687514.pdf).</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>You are allowed three absences. Any further absence carries penalty and will lead to a grade reduction. If you miss more than three classes without a validated proof of exceptional circumstances, you will lose grades, one for every absence. Please send a formal email to your Teaching Assistant (TA), if you are missing any lecture. Please note that if you fail to grade your peers for their in-class presentation, you will be marked absent for that class. If you are missing from the classroom during class presentation, you will not be allowed to grade your peers.</p>\n\n<p>Please note: it is your responsibility and not the TA&rsquo;s to ensure that you have been marked for your class attendance. We will keep track of late comers to class and if you are consistently late to class, it will affect your class participation grade.</p>\n</div></div>",

The course will help them to realise this project by providing structured and systematic engagements with writing in a classroom environment, and sustained mentorship. This&nbsp;will include various W-T-L (Writing to Learn) exercises, short writing assignments, studying the structure of an academic paper, reading exemplar papers within the student&rsquo;s chosen form, narrative-building, using Generative AI, communicating research findings. At the end of the course, students should be expected to have a clear understanding of the form in which they are working, produce writing of a good standard, be able to communicate their work to others, and reflect on their own research trajectory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course will have two components:</p>\n\n<p>a reading-and-writing component designed in classic ICT mode, where we will take students through the conceptual elements underpinning research, coupled with W-T-L (Writing to Learn) exercises that include short writing assignments to a wide range of prompts.</p>\n\n<p>the project component, where students will work on their individual projects on their own but maintain a short reflection log on how they solve the narrative problems they encounter while working on their projects.</p>\n\n<p>It is almost as though the course has a braided format, where the first strand is meant to help illuminate &ndash; and solve &ndash; the specific writing problems that occur in the practice of the second. But the link is not a direct one. In fact, we will mix up the more &ldquo;useful&rdquo; components &ndash; the structure of scientific research papers, say, or analyzing argumentation moves in an &ldquo;Opinion&rdquo; piece published in <em>Nature</em>&nbsp;&ndash; with ones less apparently &ldquo;useful&rdquo;. For example: Can you write three paragraphs describing exactly what you do in the lab? Be as specific in your descriptions as possible. (There is enough evidence to show that low stakes writing exercises of this sort, specifically deployed in STEM classrooms, help students become much better writers in their high stakes writing projects, such as their PhD thesis, journal papers or grant applications.)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This will be a 4-credit class that will meet once every week for three hours. The faculty member working with the students is not a subject-matter expert. Instead, their training is in writing pedagogy and, specifically, in providing critical feedback to a student through a structured mechanism of meeting. They will&nbsp;respond to the particular needs of both the group as a whole and the individual student. The student will be graded on their familiarity with the components of research writing; a portfolio of all the formative low-stakes writing exercises; a presentation of their work to a mixed audience; a process journal that records their writing struggles with their main project. The students&rsquo; mentor/supervisor will need to be apprised of this course&rsquo;s aims and methods and may be consulted by the faculty member teaching the course.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>To be provided at the beginning of the course.</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The class will meet once a week for three hours.

How do we imagine or visualize the body of the state? Do borders prevent people from coming in or getting out? The carving of the world into empires and then states and their territorial representation as political maps, is a specific and recent historical development. This course seeks to trace this development by examining the intersection between geography, power, and politics, as showcased in the ways in which we understand spaces, places, and territories. In the process, the course hopes to explore how we embody space as individuals, citizens, and humans. Along the way we try to ask some fun questions, such as - does cartography represent the physical or the ideological conception of a nation? Does empire&rsquo;s shadow still impact the ways in which the world functions today? Does cyberspace exist as a virtual abstraction or is there a material politics that undergirds its existence?

In Islamicate cultures moreover, oral narratives, Sufi lyric traditions, and illustrated manuscripts are crucial in defining cities.

The study of ancient foodways is not merely an understanding of what people ate in the past rather it&rsquo;s a process of understanding the interrelation between human diet and ecological, biological, social and ideological processes. Therefore, the study of foodways can potentially provide us with sufficient evidence to reconstruct the social, cultural, political, economic, technological, and ecological aspects of ancient societies. Once regarded as a rather unexciting field of studies associated with basic subsistence, paleodietary studies have been rejuvenated in recent years by both recent advances in scientific methods and new theoretical perspectives. In this course, we aim to first understand the major shifts in human food practices, and the major theoretical and methodological advancements to reconstruct ancient diets and then how the information gathered can potentially be used to reconstruct social, political, climatic, and economic aspects of past societies and the health and wellbeing of the indigenous population practicing traditional diet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>5 Reading Reviews: (5*5) = 25 (You have to submit at least 6 out of which the best 5 will be counted towards the final marks)</p>\n\n<p>Before class begins, you will submit a short synthesis (approx. 1 page single-spaced) on that week&rsquo;s readings.

The presentation should include summative information like research goals and objectives, data analysis, interpretation etc., but also demonstrate the development of critical thinking skills. Each presentation should include at least one example or case study that matches the topic but are different from the case studies included in the readings, a popular example would be appreciated, but students are advised to be aware of websites and popular articles that include inappropriate information. Students will end their presentation with two discussion questions for the class. Seminars will be ongoing during the term. We will decide the topic of your presentation on the first day of class. Please go over the syllabus before the class begins and choose a few topics that excite you the most.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Students are encouraged to ask appropriate, respectful, and professional questions to the presenter.

Firms are organized on a global scale (for example, in the production of iPhones and bicycles) and choose to offshore parts, components, or services to producers in different countries. Global Supply Chain (GSC) and Global Value Chain (GVC) analysis have been the leading frameworks for analyzing and understanding market integration and the linkages between globalization and development.</p>\n\n<p>This course is designed to equip students with the essential tools used in GSC and GVC analysis, and to apply these tools and knowledge across various countries and industries. The course will cover the theories, methodology and case studies across different contexts. The course will utilize a wide variety of readings on theoretical frameworks from international trade, and then deal with empirical developments, focusing on participation and positioning in GVCs (both at backward and forward GVC).</p>\n\n<p>The course will also explore some specific governance issues within transnational supply chains, and assess the economic, social and environmental effects of globalized supply and value chains across agriculture, manufacturing and services. Students will be required to prepare papers on country-based or industry-specific GVCs, with at least one case relating to developing countries or emerging nations, and one to developed or emerged economies. As part of the policy role in specific GVC integration, we expect students to produce a set of policy briefs and studies, mainly to ensure the participation and positioning of different groups and regions in moving up the value chains.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course will introduce the idea of transformational change in which the exchange takes place beyond looking at gross exports into trade in value added flows where countries settle on a point in value chains that themselves transcend international borders. The main objective of the course is to help students learn and understand the supply chains in all commodities ranging from an airplane to cell phones to a chocolate where before becoming a final product they crosses international borders several times. The course is mildly theoretical in understanding the concepts but is largely applied and empirical. This course is designed to give students the essential tools used in Global Supply Chain analysis, and to apply these tools in writing an integrated course papers either individually or in a group for a country and industry (decided with consultation). Course intends to familiarize students with theories, empirical &nbsp;instructors are intimately familiar with the theories, empirical methodology and real world applications.</p>\n\n<p>The first half of the course will introduce students to the idea of global supply chains drawing both from economic theory but also management science. The course will cover both the historical evolution of global supply chains in different contexts that bear on outcomes&nbsp; sector outcomes and policies; as well the way ahead as wide ranging technological and institutional revolutions take place. The second half of the course will study real world examples that are applications with different contexts in market outreach, expansion and in response to shocks. It will dwell in the interplay between domestic and foreign value added. &nbsp;We will try to understand the evolution of the key concepts and how they relate to the evolving supply chains.</p>\n\n<p>Students will be using basic skills in simple software like excel and Stata. Exercises will be given heavily focused on case studies seeking analytical perspective. A very good resource that we will refer to is https://www.globalvaluechains.org/. There are other resources from OECD, UN organizations.</p>\n\n<p>As outlined in global value chains center at Duke we will be looking at GVC lead firms and their global supply chains; and (2) country upgrading trajectories, which define how countries are tied into global industries, and their economic, social and environmental impacts.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Microeconomics</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance and class participation (15% of grade).</p>\n\n<p>Assignment (individual) narrative assessment &ndash; write up and presentation &ndash; (10% of grade)</p>\n\n<p>Empirical analysis based on data or critical empirical review (write up and presentation (individual assignment accounting for 15% of grade)</p>\n\n<p>Term paper (10 pages max, done as group work) accounting for 20% of grade (Team size function of class size &ndash; write up and presentation</p>\n\n<p>A group project called Policy and design challenge involves policy paper or brief for participation and positioning in GSC: (contingent team size). &nbsp;Positive and negative shocks how they have impacted GSC&ndash; accounting for 15% of grade.</p>\n\n<p>An end of the term exam (possibly) but not certain &ndash; conditional 25% of the grade</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Attendance and class participation account for 15% of grade</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/Syllabus_Global Supply Chains january1 _2442a69a-9192-4628-be18-ffa4adec1068.pdf'>Syllabus_Global Supply Chains january1 _2442a69a-9192-4628-be18-ffa4adec1068.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

This course offers an introduction to this polyphonic tradition of modern democratic thought. It&nbsp;is organized in the form of a debate and dialogue between different competing interpretations of democracy.

Each age and culture makes its own Alexander. Depicted as prophet and proto-Jesus or demi-God and demon, each Alexander mirrors the spirit and desires of the host culture. Following in the footsteps of Alexander we will travel through time and space, traversing the width of Eurasia and two millennia in tales. Together with Alexander we will encounter topless Amazons and nudist Brahmins, venture into the Land of Darkness and search for the Source of Life. Our class will be an excursion of intrepid explorers who venture into unknown (literary) territories. In the course of this journey we will read excerpts from the Bible, Plutarch, Josephus, the Babylonian Talmud, the Quran and the adaptations of the Greek Alexander Romance in Syriac, Ge&rsquo;ez, Persian and the languages of mediaeval Europe. We will analyse the transformation of Alexander&rsquo;s legends in visual culture from manuscript illuminations to their depictions on the screen. We will read texts in fine-grained detail and also learn to zoom out for an overview of the developments of narratives and motifs. Though we will study literature on Alexander in translation, we will supplement our reading with references to the source languages and their literary contexts. In the course of the seminar you will be exposed to topics in historical criticism and narratological studies &mdash; What is a stemma? What is an Urtext? How and why do motifs transform?</p>\n</div></div>",

The question of what is noble, which is perhaps Nietzsche&rsquo;s most interesting question, is what is repressed in this project (and as such returns to vitiate its egalitarian claims in various ways). In this course we will see how one of South Asia&rsquo;s first readers of Nietzsche, the Urdu and Persian poet Muhammad Iqbal, gave a centrality to this problem in both his poetry and his philosophical prose. In this course we will read both Nietzsche&rsquo;s works as well as Iqbal&rsquo;s poems (in translation) and prose along with some other thinkers of that period like Henri Bergson and A.N. Whitehead. The objective of this course is to come to an understanding of what Iqbal meant by reconstruction and what that entails for our understanding of a political and philosophical position that takes the question of nobility seriously.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Midterm Exam: 20%</p>\n\n<p>Response Paper 1: 15%</p>\n\n<p>Response Paper 2: 15%</p>\n\n<p>Attendance and in-class participation: 10%</p>\n\n<p>End term paper: 40%</p>\n </div></div>",

In this course, we shall first study the main debates in Indian Epistemology (mainly between the Nyāya and the Buddhist schools); and then we shall discuss Indian Aesthetics and Philosophies of Art (the debate across four alternative phenomenologies of aesthetic enjoyment --in literary, visual, dramatic and musical arts), mostly in the context of recent resurgence of interest in the aesthetic epistemology of the 11th century Kashmiri philosopher Abhinavagupta. Just as every Indian theory of truth has to have a nuanced theory of error, Indian &nbsp;theories of beauty come with sophisticated theories of ugliness and disgust, which we shall discuss in detail, applying Rasa-theory to modern European art, poetry and theater---which is seldom done.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>1. <em>Epistemology in Classical India</em>&nbsp;by Stephen Phillips (Routledge 2012).</p>\n\n<p>2. <em>Perceptual Error: the Indian Theories </em>by Srinivasa Rao (University of Hawaii Press 1998)</p>\n\n<p>3. <em>Bloomsbury Research Handbook of Indian Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art</em>,&nbsp;edited by Arindam Chakrabarti&nbsp; (London, 2019)</p>\n\n<p>4. <em>Rūpa-Pratirūpa: the Body in Indian Art&nbsp;</em>by Naman Ahuja, 2014.</p>\n\n<p>5. <em>Essence of Indian Art </em>by&nbsp;B.N.

The lowest 6 Perusall annotation scores will be dropped.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1,250 Word Papers</strong> give you practice thinking about and writing about important aspects of the topics we cover in this class. They have a word limit of 1,250 words. Prompts for these papers are available on Canvas. Papers will be graded as satisfactory or not yet satisfactory. A satisfactory paper is roughly equivalent to a B+ paper. Any not yet satisfactory paper can be rewritten and turned in again up until the end of the course (May 10 2025). You can only submit two papers per week (including resubmissions), so if you want to rewrite papers, do not leave all your papers until the end.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Paper Consultations </strong>consist of discussing your paper with me.

The course provides a critical overview of development theories, including classical political economy, modernization theory, dependency theory, postdevelopmentalism, feminist theories of development, sustainable development, and so on. It traces the ideas of development from the 19th century onward, with a particular focus on development thinking in the post-World War II period. At the same time, the course examines certain development projects for a more grounded understanding of how &ldquo;development&rdquo; occurs, to whose benefit, and why there is little consensus on what development entails. The course also engages with the multiple ways in which development processes interact with and reshape the environment, thereby affecting the realities of people around the world, and the Global South in particular. To this end, the course specifically focuses on debates and theories around sustainability. It problematizes the idea of sustainability in a world governed by neoliberal development paradigm and faced with both environmental crises and injustices. Upon completing this course, students are expected to learn:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>a. A set of theoretical tools and analytical lenses by which to understand the processes, relationships, and phenomena involved in what we call &ldquo;development&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustainability.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>b. The distinct implications that different theories of development have&nbsp;for policy, academic work, and social activism and change.</p>\n\n<p>c.

Recent developments of high throughput technologies have opened an unprecedented level of data for dissecting a genome that has opened up new ways of deciphering genotype-phenotype correlation. We will expose the students to these new ways of understanding genomes and show how the genomic data can be used to understand functional features. Building on the genomics foundation, the next section of this course focuses on functional proteomics. This field explores the protein content and modifications that are crucial for regulating cellular functions. We will begin by examining the fundamentals of protein folds and structural elements that determine protein function. Additionally, we will touch on key software tools used for sequence analysis and protein structure visualization. In the following part, we will explore experimental approaches for proteomics analysis, including various high- throughput techniques.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Basic concepts, methods, and applications in the light of modern biological problems.<br />\nStudents will learn about the genomes and history of genomic analysis including some of the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology and the evolution of various NGS platforms.

The course on Real Analysis introduces the student to the ideas and methods of this area. A firm grasp of these is necessary for further studies in areas like Topology, Complex Analysis, Harmonic Analysis, Functionl Analysis, Differential Equations, Probability etc.</p>\n\n<p>The keywords for this course are converegence and continuity. Some of the basic ideas learnt in the course on Calculus are made more rigorous here. We understand the notion of limits of sequences and series of numbers and of functions</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Understanding the basic ideas of convergence of sequences and series, continuity and differentiability of functions, uniform convergence and uniform contiuity, Riemann and Riemann-Stieltjes integrals, approximation.</p>\n\n<p>The ability to write clear proofs. The ability to solve problems.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>It is absolutely essential that the student understands very well the major concepts taught in the Calculus course.</p>\n\n<p>Though the ideas of this course are simple, several of them have to be absorbed in a short time. You can prepare yourself by revising your Calculus before starting on this course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The text for this course is</p>\n\n<p>K. A.
