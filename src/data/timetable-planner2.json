Eliot&rsquo;s Waste Land; novels and how their social function and meaning vary from Joseph Conrad&rsquo;s Heart of Darkness to Amruta Patil&rsquo;s Kari; lyric poetry and how its modes of intimacy have transformed from Sappho&rsquo;s fragments, Amir Khusro&rsquo;s ghazals, and William Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets to Audre Lorde&rsquo;s poetry; drama and how its representation of gender has morphed from Kalidasa&rsquo;s Shakuntala to Caryl Churchill&rsquo;s Top Girls; and short stories and how their uncanny imaginative scope has been reconfigured from E. T. A. Hoffman to Saadat Hasan Manto and Ismat Chughtai.&nbsp; We will also read some theories of literature and literary transformation, including essays by Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakhtin, T. S. Eliot, Bertolt Brecht, and Sigmund Freud.</p>\n</div></div>",

We will be reading and discussing epic, tragedy (and drama more broadly), lyric poetry, the short story and the novel. Our focus on the making of these genres will allow us some freedom in the worlds we roam&mdash;from the classical to the contemporary, traversing many parts of the globe through different literary cultures.</p>\n\n<p>In thinking through form historically, we will begin by assuming that literary genres articulate the material foundations we recognize in their social and historical contexts. We will trace how the evolution and sedimentation of these forms reflects the conditions of their making. Along the way, we&rsquo;ll think about the many ways in which human beings have considered their place in the world, about what it means to be, live, love, act, work, desire, write and create&mdash;questions that seem to reach out from the particular places and times in which they are asked, even as they tell us all the more about how those places and times were inhabited and imagined.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our readings will include epic texts like The Odyssey and Paradise Lost; drama that includes both Sophocles&rsquo; Antigone and Bertolt Brecht&rsquo;s Mother Courage and Her Children; works by Chaucer and T. S. Eliot, poetry from down the ages and across the globe, including Sappho and Du Fu, Shakespeare and Kabir, Langston Hughes and Meena Kandasamy; and fictional writing that includes story cycles from earlier eras, some of the great short stories of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and a novella.

In the process, the course will explore a varied and rich tapestry that includes rock art, the Harappan Civilization, the Mahabharata&rsquo;s many stories, the iconic emperors Ashoka and Akbar,&nbsp; and the words of the Buddha and the &nbsp; Bhakti saints. Indian civilization, as the course will emphasize, is not to be seen merely as part of the dead past but as an element that continued to be invoked in present times, by literary giants like Rabindranath Tagore and statesmen like Jawaharlal Nehru, and by more ordinary people in India&rsquo;s villages and towns.

The aim of this course is to take that understanding further and to make it deeper.</p>\n\n<p>We will study:</p>\n\n<p>sequences and series of real numbers and their convergence</p>\n\n<p>sequences and series of functions, their convergence and unifom convergence; power series</p>\n\n<p>continuity, uniform continuity, differentiability, integration (all more rigorously than in the Calculus courses)</p>\n\n<p>elementary functions like trigonometric, hyperbolic, exponential funcions</p>\n\n<p>basic ideas of approximation</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course introduces rigorous arguments and is very important for further studies in mathematics. Many later courses, both in mathematics and applications, depend on the understanding gained in this course.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>A good understanding of rigorous concepts of elementary analysis. Development of skills to write rigorous proofs. Development of skills for solving problems.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students must have taken the course Calculus befoe taking this course.</p>\n\n<p>The main text book would be</p>\n\n<p>K. A. Ross, Elementary Analysis: the Theory of Calculus, Springer.</p>\n\n<p>References.</p>\n\n<p>W. Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis</p>\n\n<p>T.

The course will follow a critically reflexive pedagogy, urging students to consistently question developmental givens, introspect on their development and hence develop a nuanced understanding of technical concepts. Pedagogical tools will include a combination of play, reflexive exercises, art work and film clippings. The course intends to&nbsp; ask the following questions: How do nature and nurture together shape development? How do children shape their own development?

However, if illness prevents you from attending class for a longer period of time and you would like more absences excused, you will be asked for documentation from a doctor or nurse practitioner for each of the past absences to determine if that is possible. Additional excused absences are possible only if the past five absences have been due to health reasons and have proper documentation. In previous iterations of the course, we have seen students taking discussion sessions lightly. The discussion sessions are very important, and help consolidate learning from lectures. Please treat discussion sessions on par with lectures.</p>\n</div></div>",

This enables activities such as online shopping, sending delightful emojis to friends, or even reading this very text. All of this is made possible through extraordinary engineering, which is grounded in fundamental physical laws that we can represent mathematically, allowing us to make informed predictions. This is one of the many places where a mathematical model allows us to make predictions that can be employed for other uses.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this course, we will explore various methods of utilizing mathematics to model problems and apply these models to generate predictions that can significantly impact our daily lives. We will go over the enderlying mathematics&nbsp;that would be required to come up with such models.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The emphasis of the course will be on the conceptual framework and methodology rather than on computational techniques. Throughout the course, we will introduce several tools designed to facilitate calculations and enhance visualization.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the course, we&rsquo;ll pass through the following topics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>How much change do I have to give at the supermarket?&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>What is the language of mathematics?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Am I going on a straight line or in a circle?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Are numbers really Real?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>How to survive barter system</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>How many leaves does a tree have?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>What are the chances of winning in a game of poker?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>How do I do my taxes?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>This statement is a lie!</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>It is expected that students would understand the words underlying &quot;QRMT - Quantitative Reasoning and Mathematical Thinking&quot; both separately and together as well.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This course does not require any prior knowledge; all that is needed is a willingness to engage with mathematics and reasoning, as well as the determination to conquer any apprehensions related to the subject.

The global focus on economic growth and development has led us onto an unsustainable path: growing scientific evidence now suggests that the Earth may not be able to cope with the demands imposed on it. &nbsp;This has created an urgent need to critically examine complex environmental issues from a variety of perspectives. It is necessary to inculcate holistic thinking on environmental challenges and their purported solutions, that includes concerns of social and ecological sustainability. &nbsp;This course will discuss some of the most current concerns related to the environment, as well as societal responses to them, from a multidisciplinary perspective. Water scarcity, climate change, forest degradation, biological extinction, pollution and agrarian distress are some of the issues that will be studied. This course is intended to familiarise students with environmental problems&nbsp; and engender a holistic perspective in understanding causes and possible solutions through the lens of science and equity. This course will encourage students to synthesize information across a variety of sources.Practically the course will be taught using a combination of lectures, movies, slideshows and in-class discussions. Discussion on assigned readings will engender critical thinking and debate in class. Students will undertake group projects on current case studies (such as river pollution, tiger tourism etc.).

It asks a broad range of questions that are both theoretically and substantially important. What are states and how did they become the primary form of political organization in the world? Why are some states more capable than others? Why are some countries more prosperous than others, is there one or many paths toward economic development? Why is inequality rising across the world? What is ethnicity and nationalism and why is it associated with conflict and violence? What is globalization, and why is it celebrated in the Global South and associated with rising populism in the West? We will integrate theory with case studies from across the world.</p>\n\n<p>As an introductory course, it will also place an equal emphasis on familiarising students with the political science &lsquo;approach&rsquo; to studying politics and society. A thorough understanding of the scientific enquiry will prepare you to expertly read empirical (that is, research that is based on observation) journal articles and books. We will understand the logic of comparing cases to draw inferences in a scientific manner. We will become comfortable with thinking about politics in terms of unit of analysis, independent and dependent variables, and alternative explanations. The course will also explain how political science attempts to reach causality, that is, how evidence is used to make convincing claims that a particular factor &ldquo;causes&rdquo; a phenomenon (state capacity, economic development, civil wars) more significantly than others.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The goals of the course are three-fold. By the end of the course, students should have an overview of some of the major debates in the field of comparative politics. This will prepare students to take advanced courses in political science and other social science departments. Second, the course will reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form. Finally, the course will also augment students&rsquo; intellectual ability to take an informed stand in contemporary political debates and become more consummate readers of news and popular media.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Reading list from the previous iteration of the course.

Students may get a better understanding of the theoretical treatments of some of the ideas when they perform experiments in PHY-2020 course. In the second part of the course, we shall focus exclusively on electromagnetic waves and their properties with particular emphasis on visible window of electromagnetic waves and its interaction with the matter. The theoretical treatments that you have studied in the last semester (PHY-2210 and PHY-2310) are essential for this course, and this course, in some sense, &nbsp;is a continuation of those two courses at a slightly advanced level.

We will end with the fragmentation of the Mughal Empire and the rise of regional states in the eighteenth century. Within this time-frame, we will explore the rise and fall of sultanates and kingdoms, the dynamics of commercial production and mercantile traffic, the workings of kingly power, the techniques of military engagements, and the nature of social hierarchies and oppression. We will also closely study the relationships between gender and politics, religion and society, language and power, art and statecraft, language and culture. We will look at sufis and merchants, rulers and slaves, princesses and labourers, horses and elephants.

The syllabus is designed to familiarize the students with select concepts and ethnographies of the discipline. We will discuss the sociology and anthropology of kinship, social stratification (caste, race, tribe), cities, migration, nationalism, and environment. Rather than treating these as independent concepts, we seek to show their inter-relation with other social phenomena. For example, how are notions of family and kinship intertwined with science and technology studies; what is the connection between migration and urban transformations, how does one critically study the relation between environment and tourism etc. By doing this, the course demonstrates how the sociological approach explores and finds relations and connections between people, places, and objects. The objective of this course is to develop students&rsquo; appreciation of concepts and categories and their evolution and innovation. This course will also demonstrate to students how theory, ethnography and critical thinking can be integrated. Course materials will include examples from India as well as other parts of the world, and will offer a representative overview and not exhaustive coverage of all topics and perspectives existing in the discipline.

Does the clearing of a debt signal the end of a relationship? Is reciprocity a good thing after all? What happens when you refuse a gift? If being creditable is a respectable characteristic, why are creditors typically such villainous characters? Is being indebted a show of strength or sign of weakness? What goes into making a price? What does it really mean for a thing to be priceless? If time is indeed money, is money also in some way a form or measure of time?</p>\n\n<p>This course is an intensive introduction to the anthropology of exchange through the circulation of gifts and commodities across diverse times and places.

Homo sapiens is a social creature who universally builds enduring cooperative relations with fellows. While learning to become and remain a social being is a universal human process likely rooted in our evolutionary makeup, the categories and the frames through which humans relate to, socialize, and cooperate with fellow humans display great diversity across history and geography. Studying these diverse frames of relatedness and asking theoretical questions about what is constant across differences is the primary preoccupation of anthropology as a discipline. Marriage, family, and kinship, in particular, have proved to be near-universal frames, provoking generalizing theories to explain their prevalence and underlying logic. War, enmity, conflict, and rivalry, in the meanwhile, present an equally prevalent frame of relationship. Throughout this course, we will engage with key theories that inform anthropological inquiry on these diverse forms of cooperation and conflict.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/Kin Friends Enemies Course Details Can Evren_d7ae3284-5676-4576-a25c-34b25fc1f4ca.docx'>Kin Friends Enemies Course Details Can Evren_d7ae3284-5676-4576-a25c-34b25fc1f4ca.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

Through a study of theoretical approaches, we will explore the impact of colonialism on ethnic identities, the legacy of decolonization on nationalist movements, and the challenges that multiethnic states face post-independence.

How can ethnic identity, if it is a causal factor, be integrated into predictive theories? What are the origins and constructions of ethnic identity, and how do they relate to nationalist movements? We will assess both theoretical and empirical studies to critically evaluate whether existing models adequately address these issues.</p>\n\n<p>Designed to equip students with critical analytical tools, this course aims to cultivate historical and theoretical perspectives on ethnic conflict.

Seeking answers to these questions, this course brings in dialogue the works of art with the spaces that such works have come to inhabit in our present world &ndash; museums, art galleries, and other spaces of visual exhibitions. Moving beyond the established trajectories of looking at exhibitions, museums, and gallery spaces as storehouses of masterpieces of Art, or merely as spaces of ordering, classifying, and displaying objects and images, we will look closely at how exhibition practices of museums and public art galleries, constitute the very category &ldquo;Art&rdquo; around a select body of objects and images. Beginning with early modern royal and notable private collections, and cabinet of curiosities across the world, the course will explore the specific moments of the coming into being of public museums and art galleries through fairs, &ldquo;freak shows&rdquo;, and world exhibitions in Europe and across different parts of the world. It will explore how politics of collection, museum acquisition, display, and repatriation are tied with larger questions of colonialism, war, loot, postcolonial nationalist reassertions, and postwar encounters with race and ethnicity. With a specific focus on Asia, the course will map the connected global trajectories of museums, art galleries and memorials as dense narratives of unfolding spatial and temporal complexes. In the process it will highlight the role of the artists, curators, and museum/ gallery visitors in the production of a complex set of dialogues around artistic, and curatorial visions. The course will end by looking at contemporary South Asia, mapping the challenges of redesigning exhibition orders of older museums and art institutions and spread of museum modes of display and viewing, with different intent, in commemorative sites, theme parks, memorials, and new temples. This co-constitution of art and art museums will be addressed during class discussions and during compulsory and graded off campus museums galleries, and site classes and&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash; to the Indian Museum, Kolkata (virtual), the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi (on site), the National Museum, New Delhi (on site,) the National Handloom and Handicrafts Musem, New Delhi, (on site), the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal, Nodia (on site), the Swaminarayan Akshardham&nbsp;Complex, New Delhi (on site),&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhai Mati Das Museum (on site),&nbsp; the British Museum, London (virtual) and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (virtual).</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>On successful completion of the course, we will be able to: a) Explore the main trends in the development of Art History, Visual Culture and Museum Studies by accessing the critical essential skills. b) Evaluate the approaches of artists, art historians, and curators to the field of visual arts and museum studies c) Explore curatorial practices in the art world d) Develop the interests for a future training in art curatorial programme and critical museum studies.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Modules</p>\n\n<p>Introduction to the Scope and Aims of the Course: Why Museums?

The topics covered will include physiological ecology, population ecology, species interactions, community ecology, succession and disturbance; ecosystem ecology, and biogeochemistry. Topics introduced in the lectures will be followed by in class-activities (and simulations) and discussions. For discussion sessions, I will suggest classic and recent research papers and students will lead discussions based on those.

The concept of social exclusion as an analytical framework has become increasingly relevant for an understanding of the notions of environmental inequality, conflicts, rights and justice. The course will capture the social exclusion structures and processes which restrict the access of certain social groups to environmental resources and entitlements. It will explain the different forms of social disadvantage &ndash; in village and community, in land and water, in space and commons, in wilderness and conservation &ndash; that persist, in multiple variants and with different intensity, across societies and nations. It will locate the agency to groups that either guard their domain of privilege or challenge the system of social inequalities and segmentation. Thus, understanding social exclusion as a condition/outcome as well as a dynamic process, the course will also examine some environmental justice movements. The course will also be contextually and temporally embedded. In the north, for example, along with African-Americans, Latino and indigenous people, the focus has been the changing nature of social exclusion in environment. Accordingly, the relevant focus groups are the new social groups, including the immigrants and ethnic groups. By contrast, in the Indian context, the problem is one of the persistent, multiple exclusion of certain social groups like Dalit affecting their basic environmental access and rights.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course is organized around weekly lectures and discussions based on the readings.

Every session is a crucial step in planning our grand economic heist. Miss one, and you might miss the blueprint to the next big score in your project or assignment.</li>\n\t<li>The Thrilling Part: In every class, there&#39;s hidden &quot;Intel&quot; - these could be strategic insights, secret shortcuts in coding, or even surprise challenges that can amplify your &quot;Attentiveness&quot; score. You&#39;ll only get access to this intel if you&#39;re in the room, both in body and mind.</li>\n\t<li>The Catch: Skipping class is like missing the heist planning session - you might think you&#39;re still in the game, but you&#39;ve missed out on the crucial details and the thrill of the plot. Plus, you&#39;ll have to play catch-up solo, and trust me, the heist plan (a.k.a. lecture notes) isn&#39;t nearly as exciting without the live experience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, come for the attendance, stay for the heist.

Between slums and smart cities, they inhabit a world of social conflict, ecological crisis, and contending visions of the future. As cities become even more central to social experience and aspiration, we need to understand their place in history and in human imagination. This course looks at cities through three thematic lenses: accumulation, order, and identity. It studies cities in relation to the countryside, tracing flows of people and goods that create wealth and poverty. It examines the spatial politics of managing urban populations, from planning to securitisation. It analyses cities as places where cultural identities &ndash; parochial and progressive &ndash; are formed and defended. It uses these themes to illuminate the political ecology of cities in the Global South, particularly issues around land, water, waste, and climate change.</p>\n</div></div>",

So much so that one often wonders if and to what extent anthropology&nbsp;is&nbsp;method? This course explores the relationships between anthropology and ethnography and those between question and method in the making of the discipline. Indeed, in some ways, the course could also have been named Anthropology&#39;s Questions. Here are some other questions we will ask: What might it mean to have an anthropological imagination or an ethnographic sensibility? How are they related? Where does the field of fieldwork begin and end and how does one find it? What is the relationship between a &#39;site&#39; and &#39;sight&#39; in constituting the field? How else does one sense the field? How long does it take to arrive at and exist in the everyday and how does one exit? How does one deal with questions of subjects and objects, subjectivity and objectivity, intimacy and scale, the actual and the virtual, power and privilege, anonymity and representation, originality and authenticity? How does one go about uncovering and establishing relationships in practice? What is the role of comparison in anthropology? What does it mean to move relationally and comparatively in conceptual and empirical terms? What are the different ways in which anthropologists approach &#39;the field&#39; and &#39;the archive&#39;? How does one go about conducting fieldwork and composing an ethnography? What are disciplinary codes and conventions, how are they established, when are they broken? In what ways might the limitations of anthropology&#39;s methods expand our imagination of its very possibilities? &nbsp;Over the semester, this course will attempt to address these and other questions through close reading, discussion and debates on a range of anthropological texts and texts on anthropology and its methods. Students will also complete a series of methodological exercises and assignments, including crafting a short research proposal.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

Tracking the movement of each individual particle in these systems is neither feasible nor necessary. Interestingly, many properties of bulk matter are independent of the microscopic details. For example, heat flows naturally from hot to cold objects, and liquids boil more readily at lower pressures. What&rsquo;s remarkable is that we can accurately predict these behaviours without needing to know the exact characteristics of the individual particles. This is made possible by thermodynamics, which adopts a phenomenological approach. Rather than analysing the complexities of microscopic interactions, thermodynamics focuses on macroscopic quantities that can be measured directly. In this course, we will examine how the fundamental principles of thermal equilibrium arise from a few basic concepts, offering valuable insights into the behaviour of these systems.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Topics that this course will cover include, Basic concepts: Temperature and the Equation of State,&nbsp;&nbsp;First and second laws (work and internal energy; heat engine, Carnot theorem, Clausius theorem, entropy)&nbsp;thermodynamic potentials and methods (natural variables, Maxwell equations, chemical potential, fundamental relation), thermodynamics of phase transition, Kinetic theory of gases.</p>\n\n<p>Reference books:</p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp; Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics by F.

We will write our own children&rsquo;s book to gauge all that we have learnt.</p>\n\n<p>This course aims to examine how the books children read shape their outlook and emotional development. We will study the historical, creative, nurturing, emotional, and educational aspects of these forms of literature and their impact on us later in life. We will also consider why a study of children&rsquo;s literature is important, and how it impacts pedagogies for children across borders.</p>\n\n<p>We will examine the views of multiple theoretical thinkers and texts in conjunction with actual children&#39;s literature. We will ask the important but often overlooked questions about this particular genre, mainly focusing on Indian and Western children&rsquo;s literature. The purpose is not so much to compare these two cultural offerings, but to give us a taste of both.</p>\n\n<p>We shall consider popular stories for children up to 12 years old, including Harry Potter &amp; The Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone, Amar Chitra Katha, Matilda, The Little Prince, Feluda and Mulan. At the same time, we will also study theoretical thinkers such as Jack Zipes, Seth Lerer, Paulo Freire, and Bruno Bettelheim to help us navigate the complex field of children&rsquo;s literature in relation to issues of culture, religion, difference, gender, and sexuality.</p>\n\n<p>We will unpack the didactic intent as well as the pleasure principle that might have prompted the writers. Authorial intent is, however, only one part of our study; the other part is to see how children and parents receive these stories. Children&rsquo;s literature creates moral as well as national frameworks that help acculturate young people. In examining the genre of children&rsquo;s literature, we will consider various sub-genres such as picture books, fairy tales, fables, and chapter books.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>For all readings that are written in the syllabus on a particular date: you should have completed your reading before that day&rsquo;s class.<br />\nPlease note that supplementary readings may be assigned during the course of the semester.

This course will begin with some of the intellectual roots of what we now call science, in thinkers such as Aristotle and Francis Bacon (not the artist, though we may also mention Roger Bacon). Then we will review the ideas of four crucial 20th century figures: Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend, and Imre Lakatos. Finally, we will explore a range of an assortment of topics such as whether electrons are real, whether the failure of past theories gives us reason to doubt the best theories of today, and what the relationship between knowledge and science might be.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

In the scientific method, we look for internal and external inconsistencies in our models, ensuring that our beliefs are coherent within themselves (internal) and with available data (external). Health is an extremely important subject, relevant to each one of us individually and as a society, but is far more subjective than say physics or maths, where we can speak of fundamental laws of the universe that exist independent of us. Principles of health science teach us about the scientific method, but also about ourselves as a species and society, going beyond the natural sciences.&nbsp;Even used in the restricted context of human health, the meaning changes from birth to death, from past to present, and even from culture to culture. This course provides a view of sccientific thinking in health from multiple lenses, including physiology, digital technology, medical history, and sociology. I hope that this will serve as a model of how to scientifically analyze &lsquo;wicked&rsquo; interdisciplinary topics where neither the questions, nor the answers, are well-defined. We will cover the following topics in the context of health:</p>\n\n<p>a) The four paradigms of science: theoretical, experimental, computational simulation driven by theory and experiment, and &nbsp;lastly discovery from big observational data.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, at different stages of human history, how would we differently think about risk of tuberculosis.</p>\n\n<p>b) The disruptive effect of&nbsp;technologies.&nbsp;For example, how did germ theory&nbsp;and microscopes change the field of infectious diseases and public health</p>\n\n<p>c) How to ask a good scientific question.&nbsp;For example, what are the many questions inside &quot;How do we eradicate tuberculosis&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>d) Last, but not least, we will talk about how to go about finding an answer for a well stated question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A sub-theme in this course will be the future of health in a digital age, where the fourth paradigm is starting to become operational, disruptive technologies like GenAI are present, but we need to do better in terms of asking the right questions and working across disciplines to answer them.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning how to think scientifically and ask questions, and&nbsp;in the process&nbsp;learn the value of scientific thinking about health, towards better health</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Pre-requisites: None.</p>\n\n<p>Books and online resources: No specific books required.

Yet, our own biography, realistically put, is confining. We can only tell stories about ourselves using the tropes of stories we have heard, and within the limits of our available language. Reading literature allows us access to wide-ranging lives and selves beyond our own self-narrative. Literature also opens up the possibilities of language to describe the experience of the self as it encounters the world. Our course will consider how fictional works from around the world and across time mirror real world complexities: growing-up, falling in love, being happy, having sex, being faithful, losing a friend, losing a way of life&nbsp;and&nbsp;facing death. We will learn to think about books as dreams, understanding how stories change via the shifting question &ldquo;Whose dream is it?&rdquo;.&nbsp; Over the semester we will entertain the idea that fictional characters and books mirror crucial real world-viewpoints, that books mirror each other, and that if a literary work can mirror the reality of living in the world, then perhaps our lives are more fictional than we think.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>1.

What does it mean to love and care for oneself and for others? What allows us to love and care? What prevents us from caring and loving ourselves and others? What forces&mdash;personal, interpersonal, or collective and communal&mdash;regulate, prescribe and even prohibit experiences and expressions of love. As the narrator in Arundhati Roy&rsquo;s The God of Small Things poignantly reflects, such questions are older than any conception we might have of &ldquo;history,&rdquo; and comprise at times unspoken and often unwritten &ldquo;Love Laws&rdquo; that determine who can be loved, how and how much.</p>\n\n<p>Our primary goal in the course is to work towards developing a critical and comprehensive language around understanding care and love as the basis for any and all configurations of relationalities that both make and unmake our senses of being in the world. Beginning our journey with selections from <em>The Symposium</em> by Plato, verses from the <em>Gatha Sattasai</em>, and poetry from the Akam repertoire of Sangam literature, we will make our way through more contemporary iterations and meditations on caring and loving such as, Roland Barthes&rsquo; <em>A Lover&rsquo;s Discourse</em> and Ocean Vuong&rsquo;s <em>On Earth We Are Briefly Gorgeous</em>. All along the way we will be reflecting on and attempting to problematize &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;normative&rdquo; structures within which care and love are usually understood and experienced.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><u><strong>This is a tentative Assessment Rubric:</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><strong>#CareandLove #ALoveLikeThat: 20 points</strong></p>\n\n<p>Over the course of the semester, you will be sharing a total of 10 posts on a Social Media platform of your choosing.

In this Great Books course, we will get acquainted with some of these satirical animals. We will encounter them as symbols, moral agents, political figures, and detached narrators. This course will, in keeping with the ethos of Foundations courses, familiarize students with methods from the different disciplines of philosophy, history, and literature: we will learn to read closely and critically, identify and respond to arguments, appropriately situate a work in its socio-historical context, and compare texts and ideas from different moments in time and space. By investigating how animals have been portrayed in fables, allegories, and novels, you will gain a deeper understanding of the power of satire in challenging conventions and provoking thought on human nature and society.

Are our social interactions forms of playacting? How about the ways in which we present ourselves&mdash;as gendered bodies, as students, as friends, as professors, and as so many other less nameable identities&mdash;are these too performances? What would it tell us if we were to think of everyday social interaction and self-presentation as performance? Does this mean our interactions are shallow, our relationships fake, and our personalities mere pretense? Or will it reveal aspects of everyday life that otherwise remain hidden in plain view? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These are some questions that inspire this course to explore the social phenomenon of performance and its theoretical value to the humanities. We will investigate the ways in which our everyday behaviours and the stories we tell shape our identities and our experience of the world. We will see how thinking&nbsp;of,&nbsp;with, and&nbsp;through&nbsp;performance can help us investigate social behaviour, individual and collective identity, and embodied knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We will do so by focusing on three recurring themes: first, the relationship between representation and performance, which will help us understand social behaviour; second, the paradigm of performativity, which is significant to theorizing identity; and third, the debate between whether performance is an ephemeral or enduring phenomenon, which is central to conceptualizing embodied knowledges. We will see, in short, how performance&mdash;as object, method, and analytic&mdash;can help us understand societies and cultures by focusing on acts of doing, ways of being, and modes of knowing. We will read Judith Butler, JL Austin, Diana Taylor, Richard Schechner, Susan Sontag, Harry Elam, Victor Turner, Bishnupriya Dutt, Erving Goffman, Clifford Geertz, Aparna Dharwadker, Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o, and Paulla Ebron. We will also engage with Dharamvir Bharati&rsquo;s&nbsp;Andha Yug, Maya Rao&rsquo;s&nbsp;Walk, and the real-life cases of Rachel Dolezal and Jessica Krug.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(Undergrads may sign up for&nbsp;ENG-2610 or PA-2610, while grads are welcome to sign up for ENG-4610.)&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Grading Rubric</p>\n\n<p>Class participation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20% &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Entry and exit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10%</p>\n\n<p>Roundtable spokesperson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10%</p>\n\n<p>Roundtable scribe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10%</p>\n\n<p>Response Posts (10% x 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30%</p>\n\n<p>Group Projects &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div>",

So first, we will lead up to the real numbers naturally,while seeing<br />\nthe integers and rational numbers along the way.<br />\nHaving reached the real numbers, we will then explore how calculus helps<br />\nus understand the notion of infinity. This will be done by defining sequences<br />\nand series, which provide a standard mechanism to deal with infinitely many<br />\nquantities.<br />\nWe will then move to functions on real numbers, which are the fundamental<br />\nobjects on which calculus is performed. We will try to understand functions<br />\nfrom a graphical point of view as well, by seeing how to draw/sketch graphs of<br />\nfunctions.<br />\nThen, we come to the notion of limits and continuous functions, which are<br />\nvery natural examples of functions that can be studied under the umbrella of<br />\ncalculus.<br />\nThen, we come to one of the fundamental operations of calculus : the dif-<br />\nferentiation operation. We define differentiable functions, and then look at the<br />\nadvantage of how differentiation helps constrain functions : this would include<br />\ne.g. the mean value theorem and the famous L&rsquo;Hopital&rsquo;s rule for limits of ratios<br />\nof functions.<br />\nThen, we look at generalizations of the mean value theorem, which are the<br />\nTaylor and Maclaurin series.<br />\nHaving studied differentiation in detail, we now move to integration, defining<br />\ncarefully the theory of Riemann integration. We then study various definite and<br />\nindefinite integrals, understanding along the way techniques to solve them.<br />\nFinally, the fundamental theorem of calculus completes the discussion. The<br />\nrest of the course focuses on the applications of calculus : this includes optimiza-<br />\ntion by setting the derivative to zero, and applications of calculus to mechanics.<br />\nAs references, we will use</p>\n\n<p><br />\n1.

The course will begin with giving an understanding of the ecological processes underlying extinction and ecosystem degradation as well as its consequences for society. The historical and political dimensions of species loss/extinction will also be discussed. The course will then turn to critically exploring past and prevalent paradigms and strategies for biodiversity conservation such as strict nature protection, Integrated Conservation and Development (ICDP), community-based conservation, crop certification, Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) and ecotourism,&nbsp; with the aid of key international case studies. In addition, current debates on Indian wildlife laws and policies will be discussed using case studies. The aim of this course is to use perspectives from a variety of disciplines, including ecology, history, political science, economics and sociology, to develop a holistic view of today&rsquo;s biodiversity crisis and its solutions. Students will be taken on a field trip to Mandothi wetlands, Haryana where they will apply their course learning to the issue of wetland conservation in production landscapes.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The students will learn to integrate knowledge from different disciplinary areas and sources (scholarly literature, audio-visual resources and traditional knowledge systems)&nbsp;to understand real-life biodiversity conservation in terms of science, policy and on-ground implementation. They will also learn to critically analyze policy documents related to conservation and write well-referenced commentaries on various topics. Students will learn how to&nbsp;engage in productive class debates based on the readings and documentaries that they are assigned.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>List of Topics/Modules</strong></p>\n\n<p>Modules 1,2,3: Causes of Biodiversity Loss</p>\n\n<p>This module will discuss the causes of biodiversity loss, specifically, habitat loss, land-use change, habitat fragmentation, invasives, climate change, pollution and overkill (hunting). Students will discuss varying perspectives on the primary causes of biodiversity loss, through juxtaposing arguments from Gold (2003), Tal (2018) and Barnard and Emmanuel (2014).</p>\n\n<p>Module 4,5,6: Strictly Protected Areas: History and Management</p>\n\n<p>The concept of strictly protected areas (SPA) is discussed. SPAs are an important manifestation of the exclusionary mode of conservation as practised globally. Due to the way they are designed and implemented, they have led to widespread alienation of local residents due to displacement, curtailment of access to natural resources and human-wildlife conflict. At the same time, they have proven useful in being able to save species from extinction. However, poor application of science, financial shortages, poor governance and administration, and lack of specific management objectives have led to a situation where in many cases ecosystem degradation is as high inside PAs as outside. In this module we explore the history, management and effectiveness of PAs with an emphasis on the importance of ecosystem management for preserving biodiversity.</p>\n\n<p>Module 7,8: Exploring Policies on Conservation-Induced Displacement</p>\n\n<p>Displacement of local residents has been a way to create inviolate spaces for protected areas across the world, with implications for environmental justice. In this module, we explore the specific policies for conservation-induced displacement from Tiger Reserves in India, with reference to the law and the implementation processes.</p>\n\n<p>Module 9,10: Human-Wildlife Conflicts</p>\n\n<p>This module explores the many dimensions of human-wildlife conflict- that is responsible for considerable damage to human lives and livelihoods in developing countries. Wild animals damage crops, kill livestock and injure and kill humans, many of whom already belong to marginalised sections of society. The behavioural, historical, ecological and political factors that determine extent and intensity of conflict are discussed, as well as the consequences for human-animal relations. Mitigative strategies including insurance and compensatory schemes, creation of corridors and village relocation are also discussed through a case study on elephant-human conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Module 11,12: Institutions and Institutional Weakness</p>\n\n<p>Forest institutions are key to effective long-term conservation, yet there is little understanding of their structure and functioning in developing countries. In India, forest institutions bear the historical burden of exclusionary management established by the colonial administration, whose legacy influences us to the present day. Students will read a set of key papers examining this aspect of wildlife conservation. They will also watch the movie Sherni (2021) to delve deeply into the issues facing forest institutions in India and elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Module &nbsp;13,14</p>\n\n<p>The Integrated Conservation &amp; Development (ICDP) Model</p>\n\n<p>The Integrated Conservation &amp; Development (ICDP) Model came about as a reaction to the dominant exclusionary mode of conservation practices in most developing countries. It aims to reduce the adverse impact of PA on people&rsquo;s livelihoods while at the same time, reducing the anthropogenic impact on nature.&nbsp; To what extent can this win-win situation be realised? Is ICDP basically an inherently flawed model or are there conditions and circumstances under which ICDP can be successful in a developing economy? These are some of the questions being explored in this module.</p>\n\n<p>Module 16: Field Trip</p>\n\n<p>Students will be taken on a field trip to Mandothi village and wetlands, Jhajjar District, Haryana. Students will apply their learnings from the course to explore the modalities and complexities of wildlife conservation in the larger landscape comprising human settlements and agriculture. There will be a guided class discussion based on the field trip and the assigned readings.</p>\n\n<p>Module 17,18: Community-Based Conservation</p>\n\n<p>The view that wild areas largely managed by indigenous communities and local residents, lately named community conserved areas or CCAs, can be effective in saving species and ecosystems from extinction, is rapidly gaining ground. Yet several scholars have pointed out that local management can result in unsustainable use which detracts from conservation. Varying perspectives on the usefulness and effectiveness of CCAs on different continents will be discussed in this module.</p>\n\n<p>Module 19,20: Conservation outside Protected Areas: Cities, Fields and Fallows</p>\n\n<p>In this module, we discuss the possibilities of biological conservation in landscapes devoted to production, particularly, agriculture. Trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and agricultural production have become increasingly visible. Traditional means of agriculture that focus on subsistence actually encourage biodiversity over large scales; increasing intensification can lead to local elimination of a range of species. In a world where food production is being prioritized, it is necessary to understand these trade-offs and the production systems that may allow for coexistence with wild species. In this context, global &lsquo;land-sharing&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;land-sparing&rsquo; strategies will be discussed. Students will be introduced to urban ecology which is another important area of conservation, given the large-scale transition from rural to urban settlement during the last few decades.</p>\n\n<p>Modules 21,22: Economic Incentives for Conservation</p>\n\n<p>Several ways to induce conservation-oriented behaviour based on financial benefits have been experimented with during the last few decades such as debt-for-nature swaps, direct payments, payments for environmental services, timber certification and conservation easements. Payment for Environmental Services (PES) has recently emerged as an important financial tool for encouraging biodiversity conservation. In these modules, PES is examined from the ecological, political and historical perspectives and evaluated as a conservation tool in developing countries, using Costa Rica as a case study. We will also discuss the effectiveness, constraints and potential of ecotourism as a conservation tool, based on examples from South America and India.</p>\n\n<p>Module 23: Invasives and human well-being</p>\n\n<p>(Guest Lecture by Dr. Ankila Hiremath, ATREE)</p>\n\n<p>Module 24: Ecosystem Restoration: Ecology and Politics</p>\n\n<p>Students will be exposed to two restoration examples- one of a grassland in Maharashtra, and one of a scrub forest in Haryana through video recordings. These examples will demonstrate the social-ecological complexities of ecosystem restoration. Based on these examples, they will debate viable means of restoration.</p>\n\n<p>Module 25,26: Case Study on Wetland conservation</p>\n\n<p>Wetlands are one of the most widespread and biodiverse ecosystems worldwide, ranging from rivers that can be seen as the fount of civilization, and human-made lakes created for everyday use. &nbsp;Yet they are poorly understood in terms of ecology and human use, and subject to misuse, pollution and misgovernance. Further, rural and urban communities who are dependent on these ecosystems have been as marginalised as the ecosystems themselves largely due to the process of urbanization. In this module, the complex social ecology of wetlands will be explored. In this session, we will revisit many of the issues emerging out of the earlier field trip to Mandothi wetland. Students, through break-out sessions, will be asked to debate the policy changes that are required for long-term conservation of wetlands that can imbibe both social and ecological values, based on the field trip, a documentary and course readings.</p>\n\n<p>The successful completion of this course will depend upon intensive reading, timely completion of assignments and tests, in-class student presentations and participation in discussions. Students should show in-depth engagement with readings and lectures. 40-50 pages of reading will be assigned each week.&nbsp; &nbsp;Students will be evaluated on the basis of one essay assignment, a mid-term test and a final term paper in this course. In addition, students will be graded on their attendance, class presentations and participation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The specific weightage of marks in this course will be as follows:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Class presentations (and participation in discussions): 20%</p>\n\n<p>Short Essay Assignment: 25%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mid-term Test (In-class): 25%</p>\n\n<p>Final Term Paper : 25 %</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Grading rubric with equivalent % and Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>A&gt;=90%Excellent on all counts.

Since this concern links two concept groups, this course doubles as a stylized and brief introduction to the literature on foreign aid and democratization. In democratization (Part I), we will consider the type of foreign interventions, the drivers of democratization, the special role of elections and the varieties of authoritarianism. In Foreign aid (Part II), we will cover the types of foreign aid, the efficacy debate, the modalities of democracy aid, the incentive of aid donors and recipients and donor switching.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After the theoretical overview, we consider a practical approach to existing political constraints (Part III), as articulated in my book, Liberalization at the Margins. We skim the empirics and put more emphasis on the case studies of the aid-democratization dynamic for Egypt, Fiji, and Myanmar. We conclude by considering the policy implications of such strategies with an emphasis on the authoritarian backlash (and authoritarian strategies for international law.)</p>\n\n<p>This course is dual listed under both International Relations (IR) and&nbsp;Political Science (PS).</p>\n\n<p>The attached syllabus is a older draft.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Through the course, students should be able to 1) identify the major issues and debates in foreign aid, 2) analyse the costs and benefits of various modalities of democracy aid, and 3) consider the policy implications of democracy promotion.

For too long considered the outcome of Western liberalism, trans* theory and narratives in fact exist in several shapes around the world. Whether it is the Sufi mehfil of erotic transcendence, the Indic landscape of hijras, or the Thai ecosystem of lady-boys, trans* theory has a rich life scattered across cultural and sexual geographies. We will transition across some of this terrain over the course of the semester as we are transported by texts from Iran (Afsaneh Najmabadi), India (Serena Nanda, Gayatri Reddy, Bullhe Shah), Taiwan (Qiu Miaojin), and France (Paul Preciado), among others. All along these travels, we will be guided by the etymological sense of &quot;trans&quot; as something that moves beyond what we think we know and how we like to think.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>A-F</p>\n </div></div>",

Our course includes psychoanalytic writing on a range of themes including: memory, desire, the transference, reading, playing, language and depression. Before the mid-term, we will read from the foundations of psychoanalysis in the four oldest schools: Freudian, Kleinian, British Middle-school and Lacanian.&nbsp; After the mid-term we will read contemporary psychoanalytic writing on the themes of mourning, violence, colonization and sexual perversity. &nbsp;As we absorb the language of psychoanalysis and learn to translate back and forth between psychoanalytic and literary registers, we will keep thinking about what makes psychoanalytic writing psychoanalytic.&nbsp; One of these features, our course argues, is that the status of the relationship between the imaginary and the real is never quite settled: &nbsp;sometimes on the side of control and other times in support of the wildness of the imagination, psychoanalysis constantly argues with itself about how radical it wants to be.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Class Participation (20%) Our course is reading intensive and depends on your classroom engagement.

In this course we will see how one of South Asia&rsquo;s first readers of Nietzsche, the Urdu and Persian poet Muhammad Iqbal, gave a centrality to this problem in both his poetry and his philosophical prose. In this course we will read both Nietzsche&rsquo;s works as well as Iqbal&rsquo;s poems (in translation) and prose along with some other thinkers of that period like Henri Bergson and A.N. Whitehead.

While it is well-established that male bodies make up the vast majority of decision-makers and participants in quotidian electoral politics, the same logic applies to contexts affected by conflict and war. Conventionally, male bodies are considered to be at the forefront of decision-making about whether to go to war, and on the frontlines of said wars as fighters.</p>\n\n<p>In the last few decades, however, these constructions of masculinity and femininity have come to be questioned. Instead, the understanding that gender affects the way in which we see and make sense of the world around us &ndash;&nbsp;and that men and women experience and affect wartime and electoral dynamics differently &ndash; has come front and center. In the same spirit, we will focus on the role of women in political decision-making and participation; their role both as perpetrators of violence as combatants (and terrorists), as victims and as survivors of male-victimizing atrocities; the militarization of gendered bodies and the impact of gender-based violence in armed conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will reflect on the gendered aspects of women&rsquo;s restructuring of economies in male absence, their resistance to political violence, and their role in peacekeeping and rebuilding societies after war. As we cover each theme, we will pay particular attention to what feminists have described as intersectionality and the continuum of violence, from the &ldquo;private&rdquo; to the &ldquo;public&rdquo; sphere, from the militarization of everyday living to overt violent conflict. In addition, we will pay attention to whether different approaches to tackling gender inequality in South Asian contexts have been effective.</p>\n\n<p>Assignments for the course include submissions that identify, assess, and integrate arguments based on the week&rsquo;s readings; an in-class midterm assignment; in class pop quizzes; and a final paper.

In contemporary imaginations, mountains are essential for the planet&rsquo;s survival and indeed our own physical and mental health. But this was not always the case. In pre-modern Europe, for example, mountains were either ignored or depicted in literature as ugly deformities that scarred the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Why did Europeans think of mountains as ugly? How, when, and why did their aesthetic imaginations change to a point where someone like the celebrated polymath John Ruskin could write that &ldquo;mountains are the beginning and the end of all scenery&rdquo;? How did European perceptions of mountains differ from that of the peoples and traditions of South Asia and elsewhere? And what role has South Asian history played in shaping modern human relationships with the mountains?</p>\n\n<p>This course will take students on a journey from early Asia and pre- modern Europe, to the eighteenth-century when the Alps emerged as objects of adventure, veneration, and scientific experimentation, which in turn, kickstarted two new modern practices&mdash; mountain tourism and the world&rsquo;s most literary sport, mountaineering. This course will then explore how these practices were deeply imbricated with colonialism, nationalism, fascism, and masculinity in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. The course will end in the late twentieth century where it will focus on commercialization of mountaineering and on issues pertaining to non-European modernity. In other words, this course will take students on a journey from a stage in human history where mountains were at best the abode of gods and spirits, and, at worst, ugly deformities, to a stage where there are now &ldquo;traffic jams&rdquo; on Mount Everest.</p>\n\n<p>Focused on the Alps and the Himalaya, this interdisciplinary course will offer a new and exciting vantage point for learning about several fundamental issues and concepts in history and the humanities. Students will learn how scholars in the humanities have rehabilitated mountains as a key terrain where modernity is performed, its limits are exposed, and occasionally transcended. They will also learn about the extent to which our knowledge of the world is framed from the perspective of those who live in the &ldquo;lowlands.&rdquo; Overall, this course will motivate students to think of the history of human interactions with mountains as vital for making sense of what it means to be modern, and, for understanding how we got there.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Tenative Course Syllabus</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><u><strong>Module I: A Cultural History of Mountains</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><u>Week 1: Mountains in Pre-Modern European Imagination and World History</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of the Aesthetics of the Infinite,</em> pp. 34-71.</p>\n\n<p>James Scott <em>The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland South Asia</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 127-177.</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 2: Mountains in Pre-modern India</u></p>\n\n<p>Kalidasa, <em>Meghaduta</em> excerpts</p>\n\n<p>Kalidasa, <em>Kumarasambhava</em>, excerpts</p>\n\n<p>Nachiket Chanchani <em>Mountain Temples and Temple Mountains: Architecture, Religion and Nature in Central Himalaya</em>, pp. 25-74.</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 3: Scared Mountain in Early to Middle China</u></p>\n\n<p>Wei- Cheng Lin, <em>Building A Sacred Mountain: The Buddhist Architecture of China&rsquo;s Mount Wutai</em>, pp. 51-88.</p>\n\n<p>Wen-shing Chou <em>Mount Wutai Vision of a Sacred Buddhist Mountain</em>, excerpts</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 4: Environment and Aesthetics in Modern Europe</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of The Aesthetics of the Infinite</em> pp. 324-369.</p>\n\n<p>Allen Carlson <em>Nature and Landscape: An Introduction to Environmental Aesthetics,</em> chapter 1, pp. 1-37.</p>\n\n<p>Jon Mathieu, &ldquo;The Sacralization of Mountains in Europe during the Modern Age&rdquo; <em>Mountain Research and Development</em>, 26 (4), pp. 343-349</p>\n\n<p><u>Week 5: Three interpretations of Change in European Attitudes towards the Mountains</u></p>\n\n<p>Marjorie Hope Nicholson <em>Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of The Aesthetics of the Infinite </em>pp. 271-323.</p>\n\n<p>Peter Hansen <em>The Summits of the Modern Man: Mountaineering After Enlightenment</em> pp. 30-60.</p>\n\n<p>B.

What do we draw? What do we draw from? Who do we draw for? What is the worth of a drawing? What is the relevance of drawing, today?<br />\nThis course examines the intersections between drawing and text, drawing and painting, drawing and photography, drawing and video, drawing and performance, and drawing and popular culture. In thinking of the everyday through the prism of theatrical reality, the course encourages inquiry about how drawings and the act of drawing itself is a dialogue about provisionality, uncertainty, and change. How do artists and artistic explorations address issues of meaning-making and shared history, politics, and culture? How do repetition, layering, overlapping, erasure, and incision transform an image, leading to alternative perspectives about how we perceive and engage with the known? How can we tell the same story in different material and socio-cultural contexts? Recognizing the importance of contradictions, ambiguity, and serendipity as integral to meaning-making processes, students have the flexibility to make interventions that can vary from poetic, polemic, dramatic, metaphorical, provocative, or incisive. You are encouraged to borrow from processes of scroll paintings, woodcut printmaking, comic books, experimental theatre, set design, photo performances, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><br />\n&bull;Familiarity with histories of image making, reproduction, and consumption of images in popular media.<br />\n&bull;Introduction to drawing as a visual language and a thinking medium with trans-disciplinary possibilities.<br />\n&bull;Insight into how/ what individual artistic sensibilities lend to and borrow from mass media and visual culture</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Modules</strong><br />\n<br />\n<u>Module 1: Narrating and re-narrating</u><br />\n<br />\nDuration-8 weeks<br />\nClass exercises will include the study of selected Kalighat paintings, Patua scroll paintings, Battala prints, Amar Chitra Katha stories, hand-painted posters of early Indian cinema, and set designs of Indigenous folk theatre.

[ENG-4405/ CW-4405] [ENG-4405/ CW-4405-1]</h4><div><strong>Faculty Name </strong><div class='cmsDescp'>Amit Prakash Chaudhuri [amit.chaudhuri@ashoka.edu.in] ;</div></div><div><strong>Overview</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>I will use the&nbsp;Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature&nbsp;and a few other texts for this course, and also bring in cinema, art, and music as important entry-points into the &#39;modernity&#39; I&#39;m discussing here. The aim is to free pedagogy, reading, and creative-critical interaction with both Indian and European texts from the interpretative parameters of &nbsp;&#39;Western modernity&#39;, while also rejecting categories like &#39;non-Western modernity&#39; that serve a merely corrective purpose. Instead, I wish to enquire afresh into the journey of literary and artistic modernity, using writing from India as my starting-point. I also plan to bring in some material from outside India &ndash; the stories of Junichiro Tanizaki, for instance.&nbsp; The question in the course title is one I asked myself as I began putting together the anthology I mention above in the late 1990s. How was one to conceive of a tradition called &#39;Indian literature&#39;? Was it the total of the various literatures of India? Or was there another way of exploring this category? It was a time when the Indian novel in English and the idea of &#39;postcolonial literature&#39; had begun to dominate. How did the modernist and avant garde trajectories of literatures in the Indian languages fit into these relatively recent categorisations? One of my own reasons for rethinking and enlarging the frame had to do with my affinities with modernism as a reader and writer, affinities that seemed out of place post-Midnight&#39;s Children, but not so out of place within the experimental histories of&nbsp;modern Indian literatures themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The use of the word &#39;modern&#39; was, and is, deliberate, to point to developments that the term &#39;postcolonial&#39; doesn&#39;t address. The texts we&#39;ll read here would follow, without too much narrow systematising, &lsquo;Indian literature&rsquo; and the way its emergence from the late nineteenth century in various languages embodied the trajectory of modernity, modernism, the avant garde, and formal preoccupations in India. The course means to question the largely theme-driven, Anglophone parameters of the &lsquo;postcolonial&rsquo; that have been with us for some decades now.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

While photographic images&nbsp;stand&nbsp;for&nbsp;real/truth of an image, ie,&nbsp;&#39;this exists&#39; in a moment in time, it is also a framing device; it is an apparatus that lends itself to&nbsp;re-presentation and reproduction of an image.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While a still image captures the fleeting momentary aspect of a world we live in, it represents this moment in specific ways. It reproduces this moment, frames it and imbues it with the subjectivity of the photographer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is this aspect of photography that this assignment explores, especially in relation to early photographic folios, albums and other incunabula as Walter Benjamin points out to us.</p>\n\n<p>Note:&nbsp; Sequentiality and Repetition could be utilised to hold certain directorial vision or poetic aspects to the narrative. Also you could utilise&nbsp;the inherent qualities of a photograph- that a photograph&nbsp;manages to capture&nbsp;a fleeting moment of a second (shutter speeds), as well as varying qualities of light (aperture);&nbsp;&nbsp;it captures certain frames that human eye cannot capture, including a point of view where human eye may not be able to reach.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Module 3: Photography and Identities:</p>\n\n<p>Reading:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christopher Pinney&nbsp; (1997) - Camera Indica&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter- Chamber of Dreams</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan Sontag&nbsp;&nbsp; (1973)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Photography&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter- On Melancholy</p>\n\n<p>Practice exercise:</p>\n\n<p>Assignment 3: Shifting from the premise of photography as that representing a reality, create a series of images that provide a convincing impression of a construction and framing of a tableau.

In order to understand the complexity of the socio-political discourse that was developing under conditions of colonial modernity during this time (roughly between 1857 &ndash; 1947), students will be introduced to seminal writings of major thinkers and political leaders of South Asia who influenced the socio-political struggles in the subcontinent on issues such as nation formation, religious reform, the caste system, the role and place of &lsquo;tradition&rsquo; and &lsquo;modernity&rsquo; on questions such as women&rsquo;s empowerment. We will focus on key primary texts, including autobiographies, speeches, dialogues, treatises, letters, ethnography, and literary fiction. We will also read relevant secondary texts to supplement the primary readings for a better understanding of the historical context as well as to gain an understanding of the discursive environment within which these debates are discussed in contemporary scholarly works.

The course will acquaint students with basic knowledge about major events in South Asia, as well as the impact of major figures and socio-political debates on the subcontinent&rsquo;s history, culture, and politics. The lecture course will also equip students to critically evaluate primary sources. Upon completion of the lecture course, students will be able to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of dominant themes, such as the impact of colonialism, nationalism, and modernity, that shaped South Asian history, culture, and politics. They will also be able to show their ability to analyse primary and secondary sources, as well as the ability to gain information and knowledge from non-traditional sources, such as letters and literary texts.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>TBA</p>\n </div></div>",

We will engage with contemporary theories and responses to the global condition of the rise of religion under conditions of modernity and colonialism. This course has two main sections: Part 1&nbsp;is a conceptual and theoretical exploration of debates on religion, modernity and secularity in contemporary political thought, where the Euro-centrism of canonical sociological theories&nbsp;are examined, questioned and challenged; Part 2 looks at various responses to the global condition of the rise and relevance of religion in its relationship to modernity and secularity in countries such as India, Turkey, Egypt, and South Africa.</p>\n\n<p>A core objective of this lecture course is to bring meta-theorisation and area studies together to highlight how current debates emerging from the experiences of the non-Western world challenge the Eurocentrism of concepts and theories of religion, modernity and secularity. We will not only study the reception of so-called &lsquo;Western&rsquo; concepts like modernity and secularity in non-Western societies but also understand how they underwent change as they were re-interpreted or rejected in new environments. Thus, we will put canonical theories under critical scrutiny to understand the plurality and contested nature of what is considered to be &ldquo;religion&rdquo; or &ldquo;secular&rdquo; or &ldquo;modern&rdquo;. The course has a rigorous theoretical basis, and students will be familiarized with the current state-of-the-art debates on religion, modernity, secularism, and secularization. The course also has a regional focus &ndash; the post-colonial states of India, Turkey, Egypt and South Africa, and a disciplinary breadth that draws on a wealth of interdisciplinary perspectives, such as&nbsp;Political Science, Philosophy, Sociology, History, and Anthropology.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Upon completion of this course, students will be knowledgeable about not just canonical theories of religion, modernity, and secularity but also contemporary scholarly works, such as Masuzawa (religion), Kaviraj (modernity), Bhargava (secularism), who have critically engaged with these theories. These contemporary perspectives, with the non-West as the site of theory and experience, will aid students to critically engage with contemporary issues related to religion, modernity, and secularity. Moreover, as the course has a regional focus of&nbsp;non-western societies, students will also be aquainted with&nbsp;methods developed in comparative political theory and global history.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>TBA</p>\n </div></div>",

The course is structured to acquaint the students with both mainstream and critical approaches to the subject, examining how these theories conceptualize &lsquo;the international&rsquo; as a field of study. &nbsp;The course is divided into three sections: the first section of readings review the state of the field and its origins, asking whose voices have dominated IR and whose interests and perspectives they represent. The second section provides an overview of the various theoretical frameworks that have come to challenge the mainstream perspectives in IR. The last section of the course concerns the future of the discipline highlighting some of the pertinent issues and questions to be addressed by the discipline including environment, global health, cyber threats and the rise of AI among others. The overall objective of the course is to give students a broad grounding in the wide theoretical terrain of the field and to sensitize students to differences in the nature of knowledge claims (epistemology) and fundamental assumptions about social/international reality (ontology) as well as political and ethical implications of different theoretical approaches in IR.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>There are four components of grading- which is based on&nbsp;continuous assessment throughout the semester.</p>\n\n<p>A) Attendance and Class participation (15%)<br />\nB) Midterm Assessment: In Class Examination (30%)&nbsp;<br />\nC) Reflections on Theory (15%)&nbsp;<br />\nD) End Semester Essay (40%)</p>\n </div></div>",

Foreign Policy Analysis is much more granular because it examines how policymakers decide. As you will learn, actual decision-making is always messier than what grand theories imply. So, from the grand and the &lsquo;macro&rsquo;, we look on the domestic, state, organizational, and personal levels to understand the multitude of factors that affect a country&rsquo;s foreign policy. In order to do this, we make use of various conceptual lenses: theories of rational choice and alternatives to rational choice, individual/group psychology, emotions, culture/identity, and more. In a way, this course will be an exercise in unlearning IR Theory 101.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are the kind of questions that this class will help you think about? Perhaps questions such as &lsquo;Why did the United States respond to the discovery of Soviet missiles in Cuba with a blockade rather than any other possible response?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Why do state leaders sometimes choose policy options with a high risk of failure while less risky options are available?&rsquo;, &lsquo;How did domestic politics impact US-Iranian relations in the early twenty-first century?&rsquo;, &lsquo;How did Nehru&rsquo;s experience of colonial subjugation shape his ideas of non-alignment?&rsquo;, &lsquo;What are the effects of social media on foreign policy?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Can small states be successful in their foreign policy and, if yes, under what conditions?&rsquo;.

The course will offer a sweeping review of collective action by communities &ndash; villages caught between rebels and military as they collectively deliberate over whom to support, economic migrants in foreign soil who use informal networks to send money &lsquo;back home&rsquo;, neighbourhood groups who organise collective petitions to force the government to hear their demands, ethnic groups in conflict who mobilise for peace and reconciliation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following examples. In rural China, Lilly Tsai tells us, state officials embedded into temple networks of their home villages refrain from demanding bribes. In the absence of democratic institutions of accountability, temple leaders, on behalf of the community, reward upright officials with higher social standing. In Afghanistan, villages with strong councils (<em>jirga</em>) organise more successfully to ward off predatory behaviour from distant state officials. Similarly, communities organise for, but also against, rebel groups. In Mizoram, regions where villages were strongly interconnected through rotating church pastors witnessed greater rebel recruitment;&nbsp;the frequent exchange of information between well-connected villages reassured rebels that their secrets will not be leaked to security forces. In Colombia, in contrast, indigenous communities mobilised against FARC rebels. The ability of a community to organise collectively affects outcomes as varied as riots, prison violence, and the inner workings of the Sicilian Mafia. At the broadest scale, to echo Robert Putnam&rsquo;s celebrated work on Italy, robust connections across otherwise disparate communities enhances social capital, which in turn, &lsquo;makes democracy work&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>These anecdotes barely touch the surface of the critical role of community ties and networks in a diverse range of political phenomena &ndash; accountability, economic exchange (we will study how Hawala transactions work), civil war resistance, democracy, riots, and organised crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In order to understand communities and collective action, the course will survey both classical and contemporary exemplars from across the social science (admittedly with a strong focus on political science). We will begin with a thorough baseline understanding of the concept of collective action &ndash; why do groups struggle to organise toward a goal that each member desires and will benefit from? What are some of the well-known solutions to collective action problem?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Building upon this foundation, we will delve deeper into specific instances of collective action. To cite a few, we will study how closely-knit social networks (imagine a village where &lsquo;everyone knows everyone&rsquo;) can monitor their members (peer monitoring, in-group policing). We will uncover the nebulous concept of &lsquo;trust&rsquo;, that allows individuals to anticipate that their peers will honour their word when rational calculations should suggest otherwise. Of course, a course like this will remain incomplete without engaging with norms of reciprocity, solidarity and altruism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>By the end of the course, students should have a sound overview of some of the major debates surrounding collective action by communities. It will also reinforce the department&rsquo;s continuous training in analytical thinking. It will bolster students&rsquo; ability to distinguish between different theoretical explanations, evaluate the merit of competing arguments made in the literature, and communicate their arguments clearly in written form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>This is a senior-level course and will follow the seminar format.

The course is divided into two modules (M1: Sandeep Ameta, M2: Laasya Samhita;).&nbsp; The first&nbsp;module will cover the principles of directed evolution and how it can be used to evolve/select functional biomolecules for various applications. We will discuss various techniques&nbsp;used for aptamers/ribozymes, proteins, therapeutic antibodies, enzymes, and metabolic pathway evolution. Additionally, some recent developments in implementing machine learning in guiding directed evolution experiments will also be discussed.

How does water shape and is being shaped by social relations and cultural practices, and how do these interactions vary across societies and geographic scales? In what ways does&nbsp;power&nbsp;mediate people&rsquo;s access to and control over water? This course dives deep into various epistemological and ontological questions surrounding water.&nbsp;Water is life-giving and non-substitutable. A decade and a half ago, in July 2010, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that recognized the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right. Yet nearly a billion people in the world still lack access to safe drinking water, and&nbsp;water-related diseases and deaths remain pervasive, especially in the Global South. At the same time, water &ndash; and mega hydraulic projects in particular &ndash; remains a central preoccupation for most modern states. The recent years have also witnessed increased instances of water grabbing and privatization at a global scale, giving rise to water conflicts as well as processes of accumulation by dispossession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on a set of interdisciplinary literature, this course will provide students an in-depth cultural and political ecological understanding of water, with a special focus on South Asia. Students will also get to interact with some of the experts in the field who will be invited as guest speakers. Besides, field visits will be conducted within Delhi-NCR to help student with a firsthand understanding of issues related to urban water, sanitation, and water justice. At the end of this course, students are expected to have a grasp of:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>a.

In Latin, it comes from &quot;archivum&quot; or &quot;archium,&quot; while in Greek, it&#39;s related to &quot;arkheion.&quot; This term not only referred to the place where important records were kept but also the people responsible for managing them, the &quot;archons&quot; or citizens.</p>\n\n<p>Archives are like a time capsule, preserving the past. They&#39;re unique to individuals, organisations and specific periods in history, so no two archives are the same. They serve as a reminder of everything we might forget but should always remember. Archives hold a special power because archives act as the keepers of our collective memories, providing a glimpse into the worlds of writers, artists, thinkers and organisations, that helps us understand the different worlds where the materials in the archives come from. They&#39;re like hidden treasure troves for storytelling enthusiasts, creative minds, artists and scholars.</p>\n\n<p><u>Exploring the Ashoka Archives</u>: The Ashoka Archives is building up to offer an incredible wealth of knowledge, stories, experiences, correspondences, and images. It&#39;s truly astonishing that such an amazing resource is now on campus. As an educational institution, it&#39;s exceptionally vital to emphasize that without an archive, a significant portion of cultural history, can get lost due to various reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Centred around the Ashoka Archives, this course aims to delve into distinctive viewpoints of scholars through active engagement with archives and the materials that pique their individual interests. Scholars will also delve into the dual role of archives, serving as both tools and points of reference for shaping their artistic and storytelling visions. A primary emphasis of the program will be to openly and candidly investigate how archival materials can be harnessed to spark new artistic possibilities. Through art, visual storytelling, graphic narratives, there&rsquo;s an opportunity for the scholars to reinvigorate and re-examine the information available but also to generate new creations and events that can themselves be archived, allowing the scholar artists to contribute their unique voices to the historical record.</p>\n\n<p><u>What this course is about</u></p>\n\n<p>The fundamental concept here is to utilize the Archive as a platform for artistic discussion and intellectual exchange. This will offer not only the institution but also scholars and practitioners a chance to develop fresh, critical, and imaginative methods to engage the public. This engagement will be based on the materials found in the Ashoka Archive. The emphasis lies on both the Archive itself and individual scholars, who will collaboratively produce knowledge, visual narratives, and expertise. The process is as crucial as the final results, ensuring that visual exploration aligns seamlessly with the creation of knowledge and artistic expression.</p>\n\n<p>The course is designed to empower scholars in conjunction with the Archive over a single semester:</p>\n\n<p>Creative Documentation: These projects will focus on creating content to enrich the archive&#39;s knowledge repository, ultimately leading to tangible outcomes such as mini-books, zines, and catalogues.</p>\n\n<p>Creative Projects: These initiatives aim to support creative expressions that interpret the archive&#39;s collections through visual stories, comics, artwork,&nbsp; photo books and other artistic endeavours. </p>\n\n<p>This approach can help the scholars in negotiating their findings, research and learnings through visual interpretations in multi-disciplinary formats that is much required in today&rsquo;s realm of information &amp; content, where visual storytelling is an alternate and a popular form of information, opinion and communication.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><u>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</u>: These learning objectives will guide scholars through the course, enabling them to not only delve into the archival materials available but also develop a skill set that combines historical interpretation, visual storytelling, and ethical considerations in presenting interpreted narratives inspired from the archive.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding Archives: Define the concept of archives and their significance in preserving historical records. Explain the role of university archives in the history making and the process of documentation within the framework of an academic institution.</p>\n\n<p>Research and Selection: Develop the skills to identify and select relevant materials from the university archive. Distinguish between primary and secondary sources and understand the value of primary materials in historical research.</p>\n\n<p>Visual Analysis: Learn to critically analyse visual materials, including photographs, documents, and artifacts. Identify key elements of visual analysis, such as authorship, date, context, and significance.</p>\n\n<p>Material Context: Gain an understanding of the historical context in which the selected materials were created. Recognize the broader historical events and societal influences that may have shaped the materials.</p>\n\n<p>Visual Storytelling: Master the principles of visual storytelling, including design, composition, and narrative. Develop the ability to create visually engaging and informative materials based on historical content. Explore the use of digital tools and design software for creating visual materials. Learn to articulate the stories and insights conveyed through visual interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>Ethical Considerations: Explore the ethical considerations when working with historical materials, including issues related to copyright, privacy, and cultural sensitivity. Learn to handle and cite archival materials with integrity and respect for the rights of individuals involved.</p>\n\n<p>Interdisciplinary Skills: Encourage interdisciplinary thinking by connecting historical materials with various academic disciplines. Foster the ability to draw insights and connections between archival content and other fields of study.</p>\n\n<p>Reflection and Analysis: Encourage critical thinking by reflecting on the impact of visual interpretation on historical understanding. Analyse the choices made during the interpretation process and their implications.</p>\n\n<p>Collaboration and Peer Review: Foster collaboration by engaging in peer review and constructive feedback with fellow students. Learn from others&#39; interpretations and perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>+ Final Project: the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to create a final visual interpretation project using materials from the university archive. the project to the class, showcasing the historical context, significance, and storytelling elements.</p>\n\n<p>OUTPUT PARTICIPATION: Though the output will be individual, the process of production will be based on archival research, short studio collaborations and conversations and work-in-progress presentations at regular intervals as discussed above.</p>\n\n<p>COURSE DELIVERABLES: Every student will be expected to develop, produce multiple research-based short visual stories and graphic narratives/ comics.</p>\n\n<p><u>COURSE MODULES</u>:</p>\n\n<p>The proposed modules aim to provide scholars with valuable skills in archival research, critical analysis, visual design, and storytelling while fostering a deeper connection to their university&#39;s archive and the materials available. The idea would be in exploring from the diversity of materials to create diversity of practice involved in visual interpretations. The core idea here will be to discuss the materials available to create forms and works that can bring new practice-based influences and ideas, their working process and explore the architecture of visual storytelling in these works.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 1-2: Introduction and understanding the University Archive</p>\n\n<p>In this initial module, scholars will be introduced to the concept of university archive. They will gain an understanding of what these archives are, why they are essential for preserving historical records, and how they play a significant role in documenting academic works, arts, historical materials etc.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 2-3: Understanding the Archives &amp; Research Skills and Selection</p>\n\n<p>Scholars will be initiated with practical skills for conducting archival research. They will receive hands-on guidance on searching for materials within the university archive&#39;s catalogue or database. The module will emphasize the importance of reliable sources and the value of primary documents in historical research. Scholars will be encouraged to select a specific topic or theme related to their interest or a particular collection within the archive.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 3-4: Selection of material + Analysing and Placing in Context</p>\n\n<p>In this module, the focus will be on how to critically analyse the materials selected by the scholars. They will delve into key elements of analysis, including authorship, date, context, and significance. Additionally, they will explore historical context, including the important events, and the broader historical backdrop. Scholars will be encouraged to ask probing questions about the materials they&#39;re examining and to uncover the stories and insights they hold. Scholars will also be sensitised how to handle and cite archival materials appropriately, with a strong emphasis on giving credit to the source and respecting the rights and privacy of individuals involved.</p>\n\n<p>Week 5: Presentation of final material selected + their visual ideas</p>\n\n<p>Selection and research of interesting archival material will be followed to process and distill the findings to create the core conceptual idea and be presented in the studio sessions for the benefit of collective brainstorming and discussions. These discussions with fellow classmates will led to an inter-disciplinary ideation and conceptualization, moving closer to shape and sharpen the core project ideas of the scholars. The scholars will also be expected to share the processing of their research findings along with their influences and inspirations.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 6-7: Mastering Visual Storytelling</p>\n\n<p>Moving on from research, the course will now discuss the working process of creating a visual narrative using multiple influences of form and genres. This will include detailed discussions on the various possibilities of the form i.e., different forms that can be explored - doodle narratives, popular comics, mobile based narratives, photo comics, design, layouts, page architecture, typography, sequential storytelling and the work process involved in each, enabling the students to make informed choices in sync with their ideas. Students will explore various tools and software for creating visual materials, and they&#39;ll discuss the strengths and limitations of popular software including open-source alternatives. Practical exercises will be provided to enable students to create engaging and informative visual materials, which may include designing inarratives, zines, or digital outputs.</p>\n\n<p>Week 8: Presentation of a final project draft followed by discussion on similar ideas &amp; influences</p>\n\n<p>The following week the students will be expected to present their ideas and preliminary drafts as scribbles/ sketches with fellow batchmates, followed by open discussions, suggestions and ideation to evolve a clear understanding to flesh out the final narrative. Peer review and discussion will be encouraged to facilitate mutual learning. Each scholar/ project will be further exposed to similar works through display and in-depth discussions on influences and ideas related to the project to lend a visual and storytelling perspective, enabling the practitioner to take one&rsquo;s work further.</p>\n\n<p>Besides creating multiple micro narratives through the semester, finally, the semester will move to its last weeks to create a bigger multi-page graphic narrative.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks 9-14: Final completion with a mid-level presentation in week 8.</p>\n\n<p>A mid-level draft presentation will be shared in the studio to display the work in progress after 2 weeks then followed by the final 4 weeks or the end of the semester, ready for display, presentation and production. Studio presence in these weeks will be a must.</p>\n\n<p><u>PLEASE CHECK THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT FOR COMPLETE DETAILS</u><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><u>PREREQUISITES</u>: Research based on materials available in the Ashoka Archive, writing, basic drawing, basic research photography, working knowledge of design software like Photoshop, Canva, Krita etc.</p>\n\n<p><u>PRELIMINARY READING LIST</u>:</p>\n\n<p>1. &quot;Archives: Principles and Practices&quot; by Laura A.

It will unpack the challenges and possibilities of curating across art institutions such as museums, non-profit organizations, biennales, and commercial galleries. Further, with the help of case studies, it will investigate the interdisciplinary methods of curating that do not fit into neat institutional definitions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Students of this course will also undertake hands-on training in the existing conventions of curating and also delve into new and interdisciplinary methods. The cadence of this learning&nbsp; includes, research methodology, fundraising and management procedures, exhibition-making/ project production, publication, publicity, and programming.

A modern biologist can use multiple tools to make sense of data and uncover signals that help describe how the world works. This course is aimed at providing a toolkit to help research students design field and laboratory studies and link data to models (a description of how the world works). The discussion topics include replication and pseudoreplication, randomisation, sample size and degrees of freedom, orthogonal design, and non-orthogonal observational data. The topics on statistical modelling include parameter estimation, model prediction, overfitting, collinearity, missing data, approaches to choosing models, and model simplification. This course will be taught through lectures and worksheets using the R programming language. The example datasets used in the worksheets will be from ecological, biomedical, and social sciences.</p>\n\n<p>Statistical modelling is as much art as it is a craft. Students will be encouraged to think about creative ways to model seemingly disparate datasets. For example, modelling the occupancy of snow leopards in the Himalayan landscapes might be very similar to modelling the occupancy patterns of tuberculosis in Delhi.</p>\n\n<p>Course topics:</p>\n\n<p>The scientific process in brief with introduction to Popper, Kuhn, Polanyi, and Lakatos</p>\n\n<p>Elements of study design (including replication and pseudoreplication, interspersion, randomisation, some common experimental designs, sample size and power analyses, interactions, controls)</p>\n\n<p>Confronting ecological hypotheses with data, and statistical inference (probability and probability models, null hypothesis significance testing, steps during the statistical modelling process, methods based on Sums of Squares, SSQ and hypothesis testing, Analysis of variance in regression, multiple regression, one-way ANOVA, Likelihood based approaches, generalized linear models (binomial and poisson GLMs)</p>\n\n<p>Statistical modeling strategies (hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, prediction, overfitting, phantom degrees of freedom, model specification, constructing the maximal model, selection of variables for the maximal model, model simplification)</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Learning outcomes:</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate that the same statistical tools can be used creatively to solve different problems</p>\n\n<p>Ability to design an effective research study in the laboratory or field</p>\n\n<p>Learning to visualise and manage data</p>\n\n<p>Understanding principles of inference, avoiding overinterpretation of data</p>\n\n<p>Understanding principles of good design, avoiding pseudoreplication, perils of p-hacking, and phantom degrees of freedom</p>\n\n<p>Ability to run statistical techniques and tests</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Class participation: 10%</p>\n\n<p>Assignments: 30%</p>\n\n<p>Paper presentation: 20%</p>\n\n<p>Final project and presentation: 40%</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attendance Policy</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The minimum attendance required for the course is 80%.</p>\n</div></div>",

The course will relate various theories of voting behaviour to the Indian context by reviewing some major writings. We&#39;ll begin the course with&nbsp;reviewing some important papers on the&nbsp;2024 Lok Sabha elections. We will then cover topics such as voter turnout, partisanship, electoral volatility, party organization, social cleavages, economy and government performance, and a variety of other factors that shape voting&nbsp;behaviour in India and elsewhere .&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\nPre-requisites: Introduction to Quantitative Research Methods (1007) OR Permission from the Instructor.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The final grades in the course will be based on a continuous assessment system, i.e., participation in the class including attendance (25%), two assignments&nbsp;(25%), and a final paper (50%).&nbsp;The final paper will be graded as much for the process as for the final output &ndash; with a 10% weight for a 1 page proposal, 15% for a presentation to the class, and 25% for the complete written work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Active participation is a significant component of the course, and will require more than just turning up to class.

On top of that, qualitative/interpretivist methods are often viewed as &lsquo;airy-fairy&rsquo;, soft, &amp; inconclusive as opposed to the solid, robust &amp; conclusive nature of quantitative research. This course aims to demolish all these myths and drive home the following points &mdash; qualitative/interpretivist method research is fun, challenging, nuanced, and as &lsquo;robust&rsquo; as conventional positivist research. Furthermore, the course is rooted in the belief that the binaries of qualitative/quantitative or interpretivist/positivist are not only exaggerated, but also unhelpful.</p>\n\n<p>Now, given the enormity of the tasks at hand, the course will be challenging (which is not the same as difficult). Which means, that you will be required to read a lot, reflect, engage, critique, and apply. You have been warned.</p>\n\n<p>Objectives</p>\n\n<p>The aims of the course are fourfold:</p>\n\n<p>First, to not just study methods/methodology in instrumentalist terms, but to root ourselves in philosophy of science - so we start with Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos to understand the nature of scientific inquiry. Then, we try to overturn all of them by reading Feyerabend&#39;s provocative treatise &#39;Against Method&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the module covers foundational literature on how to select one&#39;s case studies, along with basics such as conceptualization and operationalization. After that, we deep-dive into the methods themselves - discourse analysis, visual analysis, ethnography, quantitative text analysis, interviews etc.</p>\n\n<p>Third, the module&#39;s aim is also to acquaint you with exemplars (mostly) of qualitative research from Pol Sci/IR - to show you how things have been done, and to provoke you into thinking how they could have been done better. For instance, we see how James Scott&#39;s ethnography uncovered micropolitics of resistance in Southeast Asia, or how Carol Cohn stumbled upon the masculinized/sexualized world of defence intellectuals in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, we try to get our hands dirty and do some discourse analysis ourselves. So, a workshop will be organized where students try analyzing a text of their choice - which could be a film, piece of music, novel, or a government record.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Syllabus (Tentative)</p>\n\n<p>Week 1: What is social reality?</p>\n\n<p>Monday:<br />\nIntroduction<br />\n<br />\nWednesday:<br />\nE.H.

But how are these inter twined, or overlapping, divergent and for whom and how?</p>\n\n<p>The course looks at different and contrasting cases in the 20th century in different kinds of polities and economies, nations and empires.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Nature and nation explores the changing relationships of nature and nationalisms mainly in the 20th century world.&nbsp; Even though nation states are modern entities they often claim ancient lineage not only in language or culture but also with reference to a mountain, a tree, a river or an animal.&nbsp; The symbolic importance of natural entities apart, these are also subject of contest nowhere perhaps as evident as in the way around 1900 the very classes that had almost hunted the bison to extinction in the US became its protectors. Why did this change occur and was it a sign of a new kind of nationalism. The latter could include as well as exclude and it is no coincidence that the bison parks and the Indian reservations came about within the same decade.</p>\n\n<p>Nature also is important for nation states to generate more wealth and this competition between them is a major driving force of environmental change in today&rsquo;s world. Yet as with previous empires, Ottoman, French or British empires do attempt also to regulate nature and its use and abuse. Who speaks for nature how and why is itself worth careful study.&nbsp; This paper offers opportunity to look in comparative ways for instance at how capitalist and communist states, dictatorships and democracies have approached the problem of nature. Often as in post-apartheid South Africa, the legacies of the past and the racial divide remain important as parks game and wildlife mattered hugely to the white minority who governed till 1994. How does nature confer legitimacy and in what ways?</p>\n\n<p>This course takes special effort to look at societies often outside our gaze but subject to in depth research, such as Russia, China and Vietnam, Brazil as well as Scotland, Germany and France. An individual book review by each student with a short class talk is a must though it bear emphasis there will be due consideration we will use the particular case to approach general themes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By the end of term each of you will be able to think about this question in an original way.</p>\n\n<p>Why wne and how nature comes to matter to what a nation means and to whom is a critical issue in today&#39;s world: in this sense this course could be of value to any student today.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Reading list</p>\n\n<p>These are among the books that could be reviewed.</p>\n\n<p>Sections will be pre assigned either to class as a whole or to groups of five and we will debate why the piece matters and what insights it provides.

Such systems are referred to as Smart Materials as they can quickly respond to certain external stimuli such as temperature, light, pH etc.</p>\n\n<p>Smart Materials find a wide range of applications in biological as well as device-based applications. Houses having windows coated with smart materials can keep the house cool during the hot summer days by preventing the heat penetration, and same time can generate electricity as well. Self-healing materials can repair small fractures caused by applied stress and thereby increase the lifetime. For example, if car gets scratches, it may heal itself. Smart biomaterials have recently evolved as a highly fascinating area to become an integral component in the modern-day improvement of human condition and quality of life. These are said to impact the modern medicines in various ways. Tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, medical devices are some of the areas where smart biomaterials have significant role to play. Nevertheless, apart from biomedicine, biomaterials also play a crucial role in developing green technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Under this course, we will study about the various types of smart and biomaterials that find applications in biomedical sciences, electronic materials, and modern displays. We will learn the fundamental principles behind properties that make them unique in their classes. Topics that will be discussed in more details are Hydrogels, Self-healing materials, Liquid crystals, and brief introduction to single molecule electronics and molecular machines.

As the name suggests, stereochemistry is the branch of chemistry that explores the properties of any compound that depend on the three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms/groups in the molecule. Compounds studied under this topic have identical chemical structures. Such compounds, called as stereoisomers, despite having exactly same elemental composition and formula may display huge differences in their properties, especially the way they interact with biological systems. A very basic example is found in the naturally occurring sugars which predominantly have D-chirality. We all know that the D-glucose is primary source of energy but L-glucose is totally different in that aspect. It is quite commonly observed fact that a particular enantiomer of the drug is biologically active while other remains silent. All this could be explained if their stereochemical aspects are considered. This course is designed to provide explanation about how certain subtle differences in spatial arrangements of atoms/groups in a compound can give rise to prominent effects. Stereochemistry is of particular importance in the field pharmaceuticals industry where it can provide great insights about designing new drugs.</p>\n\n<p>This course will also have some selected topics from heterocyclic chemistry. The contents within this part will provide a broad understanding of the major classes of heterocyclic compounds. &nbsp;Emphasis is given on the nomenclature, structure, properties, syntheses, and reactions of the simple 5 and 6-membered ring heterocycles, such as pyridines, pyrroles, furanes, thiophenes, indoles, quinoline and isoquinolines.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Course contents:</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction &amp; Applictions:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Importance of stereochemistry in real life: some examples and a short history of stereochemistry, experiments &amp; methods</li>\n\t<li>The Significance of Chirality in Drug Design and Development</li>\n\t<li>Chemistry in 3D space, Chirality and its origin</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Nomenclature and Terminology:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Absolute (R/S and D,L) and relative configurations (Threo/erythro , syn/anti)</li>\n\t<li>Stereoisomers: Stereogenicity and topicity; Enantiomers, Diastereomers, Epimers, Anomers, Atropisomers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Conformatonal Analysis and its effect on recativities:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Conformations of acyclic systems and of cyclopentane and cyclohexane (mono and disubstituted)</li>\n\t<li>Stereoelectronic and steric principles in reactions: Substitution, elimination and addition; selectivity and specificity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Chemistry of Heterocyclic compounds: </strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Introduction, Importance, Classification and nomenclature</li>\n\t<li>Structure, aromaticity in 5-numbered and 6-membered rings containing one heteroatom</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Synthesis &amp; Recations of some common Heterocylcic Compounds:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>General methods of synthesis for: Furan, Pyrrole (Paal-Knorr synthesis, Knorr pyrrole synthesis, Hantzsch synthesis), Thiophene, Pyridine (Hantzsch synthesis), Indole(Fischer indole synthesis and Madelung synthesis, reduction of o-nitrobenzaldehyde), Quinoline and isoquinoline, (Skraup synthesis, Friedlander&rsquo;s synthesis, Knorr quinoline synthesis</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n\n<p>-Stereochemistry by Eliel</p>\n\n<p>-Stereochemistry by Nasipuri</p>\n\n<p>-Introduction to the Chemistry of Heterocyclic compounds, John Welly&amp; Sons (1976) by R.M.

Students will be introduced to an expanded understanding of Media in its older and more contemporary forms. Various media will be introduced with questions about power, access, hierarchy, ownership, control, and other forms of hegemony. Media will be seen in its mainstream, alternate forms that create distinct breakage in tight binaries. The course will look at art making as a tool to develop probing questions and expressions through a base in fictional, non-functional routes or intensities of expressions, encouraging work in visual, textual and other forms of media and its possibilities of proliferation. Participants will be introduced to selected arts and artists of the 20th C,&nbsp;&nbsp;pivotal points in Art histories where artistic forms punctured the social fabric through critical media interventions. Media and its modern forms of proliferation will be explored &ndash; duplication, imprints, text, printing, photography, still images, and moving images will be experimented with to understand the possible reach, potential, and distribution of the forms. We will conceptualise&nbsp;social, cultural, and intellectual aspects of our lives and create expressive forms through the politics of media and mediation.</p>\n\n<p>Methods:<br />\nThe course will introduce an expanded discourse on art and media and the relevance and political choices of media forms in making art a critical expression. The course will enable work with drawings, doodles, journaling, artists&rsquo; books/forms of print and publishable material - from T-shirts to blogs will be seen as social and spatial interventions creating ruptures in a social context and as a public exposition of ideas. Participants will develop lines of enquiry &ndash; through media forms &ndash; as narratives, intermedia interventions (posters, zines, poems, oral Storytelling, conversation), pop up exhibition making and other critical forms of media to address the notions of art and making of its Public, its Viewers, audience or its consumers. Channels for information and communication will be seen as mediums to investigate and experiment in creating artistic practice. 2 Dimensional 3 Dimensional works and their relation with time and space. Specific forms of media will be explored to locate contingencies of circulation and institutionalised structures of dissemination of ideas. Artistic forms will be explored and developed as possible tactics and tools of communication through interventions, provocations and reflections in social/political/cultural contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>Module 1:</strong> Abstraction and Media.

We will attempt to evaluate the extent to which each of these factors, either singly, or in combination, affected decision making on inter-state relations during the decades of the Cold War.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the course will also highlight how the progression of the Cold War decades also witnessed the making of deeper inter-connections across the globe. For example, we will consider how the distant developments of the Cold War were also of relevance in shaping India&rsquo;s position in the world. Furthermore, we will examine how the developments of the Cold War were equally shaped, not just by the superpowers, but also by smaller, poorer, and recently decolonized countries. Enabling an evaluation of why developments unfolded in the way that they did during the Cold War, therefore, the course will show how the appraisal of events from more than a single point of view, is necessary to understand the impact of the Cold War more fully on present day international politics.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will also explore the newer directions of the historiography on the Cold War, including the ways in which its debates influenced popular culture and the international perceptions of technological aid. Ultimately, we will ask, in what ways can our analysis of the Cold War help us in shaping our present day understanding of the conduct of international affairs in the present?</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/International history course and reading expanded_144bf4ac-37bc-419b-bba4-430e815725ed.pdf'>International history course and reading expanded_144bf4ac-37bc-419b-bba4-430e815725ed.pdf</a></td></tr><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/International history course and reading expanded_b46a8660-6e61-4c31-810a-77d5a1886f8d.pdf'>International history course and reading expanded_b46a8660-6e61-4c31-810a-77d5a1886f8d.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

The course will focus on evidence related to caste and sex in India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The first part of the course will take students through theories of discrimination such as statistical discrimination and taste for discrimination, based on the work of Kenneth Arrow, Gary Becker and George Akerlof.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will lead to a discussion of the overlap between economics of discrimination and related sub-disciplines that are relatively new but are rapidly expanding, viz., &ldquo;Identity Economics&rdquo;, pioneered by George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton, &ldquo;Feminist Economics&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Stratification Economics&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The second section will introduce students to concepts in social psychology such as stereotype threat and implicit bias that produce discriminatory outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The third part of the course introduces students to some of the key methods of empirically gauging discrimination in market settings. This section would familiarize students with decomposition analyses applied to the labour market (what part of the wage gap between two groups is due to differences in abilities, and what part is due to discrimination), using standard techniques from Labour Economics. We would also discuss experimental methods &ndash; both field-based as well as lab-based experiments to gauge discrimination outside the labour market (e.g. housing market), or in the field of charitable giving, or even in labour markets but during the job search process (before applicants find jobs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Students will be familiarized with literature that applies these methods in the Indian context, particularly to the study of caste and gender discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The final part of the course will deal with policy options to deal with group-based disparities and discrimination, with a focus on affirmative action policies. This section will outline the various types of affirmative action, including quotas or reservation, and discuss debates around affirmative action, focusing on evidence-based research gauging its impact.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course Outline and Reading List&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Note: This reading list could see minor changes during the semester which will be announced well ahead of time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does social identity shape economic outcomes?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Akerlof, George. 1984. &ldquo;The economics of caste and of the rat race and other woeful tales&rdquo;, in&nbsp;An Economic Theorist&rsquo;s Book of Tales, Cambridge University Press, 1984, models of statistical discrimination and the caste economy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Becker, Gary. 1957.&nbsp;The Economics of Discrimination,&nbsp;Chs. 1, 2 and 10</p>\n\n<p>Akerlof, George A. and Rachel Kranton. 2010.&nbsp;Identity Economics: how our identities shape our work, wages and well-being, Princeton University Press, Chs. 1-4, 7</p>\n\n<p>Eswaran, Mukesh: Why Gender Matters in Economics, Ch. 4</p>\n\n<p>Mario L.

As we shall see, such a view can offer a powerful framework for understandingeconomic development outcomes. It is also productive in suggesting new lines of enquiry. The main theoretical framework is drawn from models of structural transformation. While these are macro models, the empirical analysis uses the techniques of micro-econometrics. The course is heavily based on research papers - mostly published in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>To appreciate the research questions and to think of new questions, it is important to have the background knowledge in terms of institutions, technologies, endowments, preferences,policies and history. This is best acquired by self-reading.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>An indicative list of topics and readings are pasted below. &nbsp;These may change especially after conversations in our initial classes.</p>\n\n<p>1.

This course attempts to unpack such an &ldquo;Image of Africa&rdquo;, as Chinua Achebe famously described it, through a closer examination of African literary modernities and the larger colonial and postcolonial histories of African nations around the time of their formations as independent sovereign states. Focusing primarily on the novel as a marker of and vehicle for the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; in African literary cultures, with the example of writers such as Ayi Kwei Armah, Assia Djebar, Camara Laye and Ama Ata Aidoo, we will be working towards understanding the experiential pluralities of colonization and postcoloniality that underscore African literary modernities.&quot;</p>\n</div></div>",

However it is important to remember that the Qurʾan, while being the foundational scripture of one of the world&rsquo;s largest religions, is also an important historic and literary document from Arabia of this time. In this course, we will explore the emergence of the Qurʾan (from Arabic qurʾān, &lsquo;reading&rsquo; or &lsquo;recitation&rsquo;) and read it as a religious, historic and literary document -firmly situated within the cultural and historical milieux of Late Antiquity (ca. 3rd - 8th century CE). This course will introduce you to two exegetical worlds, the historical-critical study of the Qurʾan and Islamic exegesis (tafsīr). Notwithstanding their different approaches, premises and biases, they both share a fundamental commitment to close and patient reading, and an enduring fascination with the text of the Qurʾan. The initial segment of the course will focus on tracing the Qurʾan&#39;s origins within its historical context. We will delve into the intertextuality of Qurʾanic narratives and their Jewish and Christian counterparts. In the second part of the course we will read together excerpts from the 18th chapter of the Qurʾan, called Sūrat al-Kahf, accompanied by the seminal commentary known as the Tafsīr al-Jalālayn (15 th century CE). Sūrat al-Kahf is a particularly fitting since it offers a unique window into the rich literary worlds of Late Antiquity. Within its verses, a diverse collage of characters, motifs, and narratives unfolds, ranging from enigmatic sleeping youths and the prophet Moses to Alexander&rsquo;s Doppelg&auml;nger Dhū l-Qarnayn.</p>\n</div></div>",

However, long before the modern desire for &ldquo;a room of one&rsquo;s own,&rdquo; women were already involved in rejecting the bonds of marriage and claiming their own spaces. These were not best-selling authors but women who chose lives that were dedicated to God. From Catholic nuns to Sufi saints, medieval women in disparate parts of the globe found agency, community and fulfillment in single lives. Perhaps not surprisingly, the choice to live attached to God, either in community or in solitude, resulted in some of the earliest women&rsquo;s writing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course takes a global approach to writing and criticism that emerges out of medieval women&rsquo;s religious callings, from the letters of Hildegard von Bingen to the lyrics of Mechthild of Magdeburg to the vakhs of Lal Ded, this course aims to track how devotion to god also constituted a refusal of heteronormativity. We will examine medieval writings alongside contemporary feminist, queer and theological theory to discern how celibate religious life, often lived in communities of other women, shaped medieval women&rsquo;s literary culture. We will examine how the writings that emerge from these devotional ascetic contexts framed women&rsquo;s relationships with God, with themselves, with each other and with the world and how these writings might offer us new frameworks for understanding gender, sexuality, and refusal today.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

They are instead a way of keeping thought in motion and preserving a critical potential against a status quo that is perfectly able to assimilate even what appears to stand outside and in opposition to it, both in the realms of activism and theory. Perhaps, as Adorno says, &ldquo;wrong life cannot be lived rightly,&rdquo; but dialectical thinking can at least be a means to begin to glimpse something better, however vague and fleeting that &ldquo;something better&rdquo; must remain. Such thinking, Adorno argues, is at once the simplest and the most impossible thing, but is ultimately &ldquo;the only philosophy which can be responsibly practised in the face of despair.&rdquo; In this class we will follow this line of thinking from the 1920s through the 1960s, exploring arguments about the status of art in an era of industrial mass culture, the failure of revolution and the catastrophe of fascism, the domination of nature, and also, for the record, false happiness peddled under late capitalism. Through readings and discussion we will situate their writings historically against the backdrop of Nazism, exile, and ultimately post-war conservative restoration, while also keeping an eye on what they might offer us in our own thinking about culture.</p>\n</div></div>",

By writing (and revising and revising again) we ask ourselves questions and investigate our opinions and those of others. In this way writing, is something like solving a puzzle or even a crime. Just as literary detectives ask questions about motive, means and opportunity to discern who the killer is in a thriller, when we write, we ask and answer a multitude of questions to solve our own set of mysteries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By taking detective fiction as its subject, this Critical Thinking Seminar will examine works such as the short stories of Edgar Alan Poe and Agatha Christie and the 2015 film Talvar with the aim&nbsp;to train you in skills necessary to the process of reading and writing about literature. Each of the critical skills&mdash;from close reading to developing an argument to forming paragraphs&mdash; is paired with a work of detective fiction to help you consider that skill and give you topics for writing assignments. In addition to reading detective fiction and watching a few detective films, we will read some secondary works about the genre of detective fiction. The goal of the course overall is to hone your skills in writing about literature by examining a genre of literature that mirrors the process of writing itself.</p>\n</div></div>",

Is it a text which is dense, complicated, and difficult to read &ndash; or a text which is frivolous, and silly, and romantic? Is a bad book one that often has themes we don&rsquo;t agree with, or racist and misogynistic representations of characters? Are they texts that are sold purely with commercial purposes in mind? Put simply, what do we think of when we think of Bad Books?</p>\n\n<p>Depending on class, position, level of education, or something as simple as the access to a library &ndash; our definitions of what is or isn&rsquo;t bad literature changes. This course is an exploration of discourses about Bad Books, the critical history of judgement behind them, and an analysis of contemporary tastemaking. To pass critical judgement on art is not something done in isolation &ndash; it often signals social class and affiliation, in-group knowledge that is often designed to include and exclude. Additionally, Bad Books are usually considered so because they are judged largely as commodities, as opposed to art, which is a distinction frequently drawn in the process of tastemaking. Moreover, what is considered bad literature, often hides a wealth of reading practices of its own &ndash; the most relevant example of which is fanfiction, which operates on a digital economy quite separate from the publishing industry. Through this course, we will try to understand the wealth of reading practices that are the basis for the tastemaking that might deem a text such as Twilight as trash, and one like Normal People as literature.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Over the course of this semester, I would like you to think about the kinds of biases that go into taste making &ndash; and the nature of studying literature as a whole. Since a lot of the texts we study in literature are broadly considered &ldquo;good&rdquo; reading (your personal and real opinions on Shakespeare, Austen, or any of the rest are welcome), it might be useful to look at literature slant, from an angle that we generally do not have the privilege to spend a lot of time thinking about.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, I would like this course to be one to bring your guiltiest pleasures, the texts you find most difficult to talk about in an academic environment &ndash; and hopefully decode what it is that you enjoy about these texts. Enjoyment is not, after all, something without theoretical force &ndash; and to have fun with reading is perhaps one of the rare affordances of studying literature that we can play with.</p>\n</div></div>",

It reflects worlds within and without; it registers the shifts of history and culture; it is at once escape, homecoming, and homelessness. Novels can&nbsp;contain revolutions&nbsp;(in both senses of the word &#39;contain&#39;) even as they&nbsp;redefine consciousness and personhood. They&nbsp; examine&nbsp;reality in ways that include elements of the scientific or the philosophical, but through&nbsp;a distinctive mode of imaginative consideration. The novel is a shapeshifting, open-ended genre.</p>\n\n<p>In this course, we will discuss&nbsp;the ways in which the novel and the world make, remake, and unmake&nbsp;each other. We will consider the history of the novel, including&nbsp;anachronisms and ruptures; we will think about the form of the novel, including departures&nbsp;and deformations, and we&#39;ll think about ways in which novels themselves reflect on acts of reading and interpretation. Our discussions and written work&nbsp;will take in&nbsp;politics and affect, aesthetics and&nbsp;materiality. Our&nbsp;focus will for the most part remain on fiction from the nineteenth century and twentieth centuries, with a few works by twenty-first century writers:&nbsp;canonical realist fiction (by writers such as&nbsp;Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Charles Dickens),&nbsp;more experimental literary fiction (including works by&nbsp;Virginia Woolf,&nbsp; Salman Rushdie, and Paul Beatty),&nbsp;and some works&nbsp;of genre fiction (horror, detective fiction,&nbsp;science fiction, and so on) that are yet to be decided.&nbsp;As we read theories of the novel alongside these narrative works, we will think about the ways in which novels encourage us to get out of our skins, inhabit other ways of becoming and being, travel through time and space, and encounter new universes--or, as we like to call them in this course, novel worlds.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>1.

The aim of this course is two-fold: to introduce (i) the basics of computer organization and architecture (COA), and (ii) the fundamentals of operating systems (OS). In the COA-part, students will learn how programs written in a high-level programming language are executed on a physical machine. What is the hardware-software interface? Does the underlying &ldquo;organization&rdquo; of physical resources define the &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; of a machine, or vice-versa? Which factors need to be considered for designing the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) so that the performance of the machine is optimized? We will highlight techniques for designing instruction set, and pipelining mechanism for the best utilization of hardware. Special emphasis will be given on RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer). In the latter part, students will learn how OS acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user for running applications. How the computer&#39;s resources, such as the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices are managed to ensure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. How multiple processes run on the same CPU without conflict?</p>\n\n<p>During the course we will walk through a selection from the following topics:</p>\n\n<p>Introduction: Evolution of computers, hierarchical design of computer systems, hardware/software interface. Models of computation, overall system organization: Basic functional blocks of a computer - CPU, memory, I/O subsystems, control unit. Instruction set architecture (ISA): registers, execution cycle, addressing modes. &nbsp;CPU Performance Equation, Amdahl&rsquo;s Law. RISC versus CISC machines.</p>\n\n<p>Instruction sets: Introduction to MIPS: operations, operands, and op-codes;&nbsp;MIPS assembly language.</p>\n\n<p>Computer arithmetic: Number systems &ndash; Fixed and floating-point binary number representation; Integer addition and subtraction, design of arithmetic logic unit (ALU):</p>\n\n<p>Processor design and Pipelining: Data path and control unit design, simple pipeline, hazards.</p>\n\n<p>Operating systems: Elementary concepts of an OS, process management, inter-process communication, threads and concurrency, CPU scheduling, case studies.</p>\n\n<p>Process synchronization: Synchronization tools, the critical-section problem, semaphores, deadlocks.</p>\n\n<p>Memory management: Memory hierarchy; Cache architecture; Main memory; Virtual memory.</p>\n\n<p>Multi-Core and Multi-Processing (if time permits): SISD, MIMD, SIMD, Vector processing; Multithreading, Shared-memory multiprocessors; Graphics processing units; Clusters and cloud; Multiprocessor network topologies.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>At the end of the course, students are expected to learn how a complete processor is designed in order to support an instruction set architecture as well as how the OS runs in the background overseeing all operations.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Suggested Reading:</p>\n\n<p>1.

It is an attempt to cross- fertilize and open up the possibility of doing an anthropology of medicine by carefully examining aesthetic objects such as literature and movies, and to introduce those who may be interested in movies and literature to the anthropology of medicine.</p>\n\n<p>There are roughly four provisional modules: epidemics/pandemics; trans-corporeality; psychiatry; pharmaceuticals. Or the movement of germs/viruses, body parts, mind/consciousness/souls, drugs/vaccines. Unlike possibly other courses, we intend, in large part, to shift the emphasis to the Anglophone world, particularly the United States of America, as the analytical object in an attempt to wean students away from India as an ethnographic object and towards a country with an abiding religious undercurrent, although it is formally a secular democracy and ostensible trend-setter of the contemporary world. This is partly to emphasize that it may be interesting to make the US rather than India labour under the trope of religion, and, thereby, befuddle received anthropological categories.</p>\n\n<p>We intend to do this by starting with a war game called Dark Winter run by the Department of Homeland Security in the US. Played purportedly in &ldquo;real time&rdquo;, with a sitting US senator playing the President of the US, it simulates a smallpox attack on the American Homeland. We will pair this with a movie on the Ebola virus, which escapes the nuking of an African village and arrives in the US piggy-backing on exotic pets shipped from the Congo to California. Against the backdrop of the lived experience of the pandemic, and the just concluded presidential election run as a &ldquo;Book of Revelation horrors&rdquo;, we will ask if epidemic imaginaries are harbingers of the apocalypse &ndash; as is the case with climate change &ndash; and how religion, especially late-nineteenth century American Dispensationalism, informs epidemics and pandemics. We may buttress this by drawing attention to the apocalyptic novels of the Left Behind thriller series, which by 2017 had not only sold 65 million copies but had spawned a mini industry of movies, video games, etc.</p>\n\n<p>We then intend to traverse the world of transplants: body parts, embryos, gene editing, double mastectomies; then move up the body to the ineffable entity called consciousness, which seems to perpetually slip away and evade capture by either medicine, philosophy, or religion, except perhaps by the Amerindians who seem to know where it is as they appear to make trans-corporeal soul transfers to make their dogs dream better; and finally, end with the pharmaceutical industry: one that promises redemption from pain and suffering, and even the possibility, through psychedelics, of tangible meetings with God; and, in the bargain, seems to deliver addiction and iatrogenesis.</p>\n\n<p>We invite students to step up and co-curate this experimental and neoteric effort by bringing visual and literary material to the table so that the modules and the trajectory sketched above may be brought to fruition. We would be more than happy to widen the ambit beyond the four modules if &ndash; given the constraints of time &ndash; we are persuaded to do so.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Readings: TBA a bit before the new term</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Grading Rubric</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Grading: The list of readings/movies/literature &ndash; provisional &ndash; will be provided a bit before the beginning of term. Each student is expected to present roughly 5 to 8 readings (the exact number will depend on the size of the class). A &ldquo;reading&rdquo; may be chapters, articles, movies, comic strips, graphic novels, short stories, novels or essays; or a combination of any of them. The students are expected to present it in class on a designated day, to be specified in an Excel Sheet. The class presentation essay must consist of two components: 1) a summary essay of 400 words, and 2) a discussion essay of 400 words, in which the students may raise questions of the &ldquo;reading&rdquo;, relate it to other bodies of work, and offer interpretations/critiques in the light of their personal experience and/or general reading. Both components of the class presentation essays must be merged into a single file and uploaded to Google Classroom by Sunday midnight. It must also be sent to me and the TA/TF on our e-mail IDs. On the designated day of presentation, students must present their essays in class in 8-10 minutes. This will constitute two credits of the four-credit course. All students are expected to read/watch the assigned &ldquo;readings&rdquo;, and the essays written by their classmates prior to the class. The other two credits will be for an end-term essay of 4000-5000 words on a mutually acceptable topic chosen in consultation with me. The in-person class presentation essays, and the end-term essays, are both mandatory. Late submissions of either will attract a grade cut.2</p>\n </div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/MML_Naraindas_AU_Winter2025 %281%29_4c78bfa8-aef3-491c-85e0-e248d1324f29.pdf'>MML_Naraindas_AU_Winter2025 (1)_4c78bfa8-aef3-491c-85e0-e248d1324f29.pdf</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

How do anthropologists/sociologists study global phenomena? The concept of globalization has two distinct meanings. On the one hand, globalization denotes an ever-intensifying connectivity between societies, cultures, and regions across planet Earth. On the other hand, globalization denotes a normative project, one that empowers multilateral alliances and international law for governing cross-border connectivity. While scholars and the world public increasingly speak of the demise of globalization in the normative sense, societies are ever more connected, and transnational flows and crises are faster and more intense each day.</p>\n\n<p>This course introduces students to the main concepts, definitions, and theories that shape the scholarly conversation over globalization. However, the course is not merely theoretical. We will read essays on methods and examples of empirical research that inspire anthropologists and sociologists to design research proposals to study global phenomena in their interactions with local and national scales of social activity. By the end of the semester, students will develop a research proposal to study a global phenomenon of their preference by applying the main ideas and frameworks in the syllabus.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Attachment</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><table><tr><td><a style='color:blue' target='_blank' href='http://ams.ashoka.edu.in//blobHandler.ashx?url=https://ashokadocumentsstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/CourseCatalogueFiles/What is Globalization Course Details Can Evren_61cfe049-7575-456c-a7d4-21fc24c4cf7c.docx'>What is Globalization Course Details Can Evren_61cfe049-7575-456c-a7d4-21fc24c4cf7c.docx</a></td></tr></table></div></div>",

Since the Enlightenment, &ldquo;mysterious incalculable forces&rdquo; have been replaced by accountable and calculable forces. Logs, metrics, models, and experiments replaced God, myth, and magic to render the world transparent. Yet, even as colonialism expanded Enlightenment values beyond Europe, the grotesque and the mythical survived the test of time. New and old enchantments, from raging wildfires to opulent godmen and shamans, proliferate modern society.&nbsp; This course will explore how our social worlds and institutions have been shaped by this overarching narrative of modernity- disenchantment. We will also examine how subjectivity, the affective, and the mythical are not rationality&rsquo;s evil other but rather are integral to its survival. Could re-enchanting scientific progress produce new forms of expertise in our modern world?</p>\n</div></div>",

Why has religion been addressed, either tacitly or explicitly, in conjunction with magic and science? Are magic, religion and science epochal moments in mankind&rsquo;s evolutionary ascent, or are they coeval in time? How has anthropology, starting with Tylor, Frazer, Durkheim and Malinowski, attempted to come to terms with it? Does the religious history of these European thinkers, with the Reformation as a watershed, have a bearing on why they have been addressed together? Or were they led to invoke the category of magic through a colonial encounter with cultures &ndash; which the New World Encyclopaedia charmingly calls &ldquo;newly contacted societies&#39;&#39; &ndash; that they designated primitive, which in fact is the title &ndash; Primitive Culture &ndash; of Edward Tylor&rsquo;s celebrated work of 1871. The work where Tylor christens such cultures as animistic, thus setting in motion the formal study of religion through the concept of animism: a concept that inaugurates and virtually sets in stone the distinction between Us and Them, or between European and non-European cultures, or between the European past and its present, or between an enchanted, magical, pre-modern and primitive world, and presumably a disenchanted, secular and modern world. It is through the concept of animism, along with its cognate concepts of hylozoism and panpsychism, that this course will trace the genealogy of the study of religion and interrogate its consequences. We will, after running through the canon from Tylor to Evans Pritchard, examine contemporary but &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; ethnographies in &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;polytheistic&rdquo; settings such as Vitebsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dialogues with the Dead&rdquo; in Orissa, or Sax&rsquo;s religion, affliction and healing in the Himalayas. We will then look at Ram&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fertile Disorder&rdquo;, and her &ldquo;provocation of the modern&rdquo;, that extends and attempts to call this trajectory into question. We will pursue this questioning by turning to witchcraft in post-war Germany, and then turn to the fusion of magic, religion and science &ndash; or &ldquo;techno- sacramentalism&rdquo; &ndash; in twenty-first century German Hospitals. We will then, through Keith Thomas&rsquo; work, mark the presumed decline of animism and magic, not in primitive cultures but in European Catholicism, through the assiduous work of the Protestants and their Religion, thus offering us a different vantage point on why animism/magic/superstition were so important to Tylor (a Quaker) and Frazer (a Presbyterian) in framing their theories that the discipline has been historically saddled with. We will end the course by asking &ndash; through the &ldquo;animistic turn&rdquo; and Jason Storm&rsquo;s work &ndash; whether the supposed exit of animism, which presumably inaugurates European modernity and sets it apart from the non-European world, spawning in the bargain ethnographic objects and explanatory moves, is indeed true, and, if not, how are we to rethink the future of not only religion as an object of enquiry, but of our very disciplines and their founding premises?</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Readings<br />\n1.

They are expected to present it in class on a designated day as specified in the Excel Sheet. The class presentation essay must consist of three components:</p>\n\n<p>1) a summary essay of 500 words,</p>\n\n<p>2) a discussion essay of 500 words in which the students may raise questions of the text/authors, relate it to other bodies of work, or offer interpretations/critiques in the light of their personal experience and/or general reading,</p>\n\n<p>3) a 100-word abstract each of the summary essay, and the discussion essay, respectively. In short: 500+500+100+100 = 1200 words. All the components of the class presentation essays must be merged into a single file and uploaded to Google Classroom by Sunday midnight for the Wednesday class, and by Tuesday midnight for the Friday class. It must also be sent to me and the TA/TF on our e-mail IDs. On the designated day of presentation, students must present only the two abstracts (100+100) to the class in 5-8 minutes. This will constitute two credits of the four-credit course. All students are expected to read the assigned texts and the essays written by their classmates prior to the class. The other two credits will be for an end- term essay of 4000-5000 words on a mutually acceptable topic chosen in consultation with me. The in-person class presentation essays, and the end-term essay, are both mandatory.

As a state, it follows centuries of imperial dynasties whose complex legacies it sometimes claims and sometimes rejects. In the last two hundred years, China has experienced some of the most dramatic social and cultural transformations and some of the most violent conflicts of any region of the world. As it was incorporated into an international system dominated by Europe and the United States, it became an integral part of global history in new ways and, increasingly, a shaper of that history. Often imagined as a monolith, it is in fact deeply heterogeneous, home to multiple languages and ethnicities, countless local traditions, millions of adherents of major world religions, and sizable foreign communities. Today, China is the site of crucial questions concerning geopolitics, the environment, global health, and human rights. At the same time, it has inherited and continues to produce immense bodies of art and literature, distinctive belief systems and intellectual movements, and delicious food. In these and other capacities, it also informs the identities of millions of people of Chinese ancestry living around the world.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This course examines the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) and the early days of the Republic of China. It makes reference to Tibetan, Taiwanese, diasporic Chinese, and global histories as well. It offers systematic coverage of Qing expansion and crisis, Qing culture, encounters with Asia and the West, the emergence of nationalism, and the transition out of the dynastic state. In the process, it gives special attention to questions of race and ethnicity, gender, frontiers, global connections, and nation-building. Instead of a chronological overview of the Qing era, this class will deal with historical processes between 1644-1912 through the four themes of statecraft, agriculture and commerce, ethnicity, and gender. This course design emphasizes historical thinking skills (e.g. understanding causation, contingency, agency, anachronism, meaning, and so on) and highlights the voices of historical figures, both powerful and ordinary, through translated primary sources. No prior knowledge is required.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Course Objectives</p>\n\n<p>This course has two objectives. One is to develop productive familiarity with some of the most representative themes, questions, and sources associated with the study of Qing history. The other is to cultivate the ability to ask historical questions in an intellectually responsible and rigorous way. We will focus on skills of critical thinking, reading, and writing (including textual, contextual, conceptual, comparative, and synthetic analysis), as well as habits of reasonable, respectful, and inclusive discussion. By the end of this class you should be able to:</p>\n\n<p>Summarize academic monographs in East Asian studies and introduce salient points in notes and in speech.</p>\n\n<p>Draw connections between works to gain an overview of scholarly and historiographical debates in the study of Qing China.</p>\n\n<p>Trace theoretical or methodological trends across multiple empirical contexts.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Required Texts and key:</p>\n\n<p>You are not required to purchase any materials for this course.

Building on Introduction to News Reporting (MS-1101) that familiarizes students with journalism&rsquo;s first principles and teaches them the very basics of journalistic writing, the Advanced News Reporting course aims to encourage students to learn how to look for their own stories, and develop their kernels of ideas into exploratory, rigorous and well crafted stories through practical exercises throughout the semester.</p>\n\n<p>In a rapidly changing technological environment, students will also experiment with different formats of news dissemination and whether they prioritize information accuracy, context and ethics of news and newsworthiness. Through an analysis of the current news media landscape they will be able to learn the value of staying true to these tenets.</p>\n\n<p>The classes will be conducted as part lecture, part editorial meeting and part fieldwork. Students are expected to arrive in class having read at least two of the day&rsquo;s major newspapers and scoured through news websites that offer both text and video formats of news. Deadlines will be taken seriously, and any delays in story submissions will be penalized.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>MS 1101 - Introduction to newswriting is a pre-requisite for this course.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course will introduce students to the art of layering their news reports by exploring the intricacies and contradictions in the engagement between a free press, the public and government. Students will understand the concepts of news beats, and specialized reporting, developing contacts and sources, interviewing, and using data effectively as a research tool. They will learn to distinguish between hard news, features, and narrative journalism styles.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also experiment with writing news for television and other audio visual formats online, as well as learn the importance and craft of &ldquo;live reporting&rdquo; in which social media is often used to communicate stories with a sense of urgency and immediacy. Students will complement written articles with multimedia tools in the process. Those who have taken audio visual production, sound or photography courses are encouraged to use those skills while working on their stories.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Bibliography</p>\n\n<p>* The Elements of Journalism, Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel, Three Rivers Press, 2001.</p>\n\n<p>* On Writing Well, 30th Anniversary Issue.

This line captures the bewildering number of methods that historians have conjured up or drawn on to practice their craft. We will read ten historical texts written over a period of 50 years (from 1960s to 2010s) that engage with historical processes and also conceptualize their method for studying the process. For instance, Robert Darnton&#39;s book on &#39;Mesmerism&#39; examines&nbsp;an exotic theory of healing that&nbsp;immediately seized the imagination of the general populace. Darnton&rsquo;s juxtaposes this to the utter failure of&nbsp;Rousseau&#39;s&nbsp;Social Contract in rousing the masses. The question he asks is: if the greatest political treatise of the age failed to interest many literate Frenchmen, what form of radical ideas&nbsp;suited their tastes? This question serves as a doorway into study of popular culture and, it also questions the general historical assumption that it is the works of big theorists that move&nbsp;history. Paul Feyeraband in his book&nbsp;Against Method&nbsp;takes the example of Galileo to make a case that science should have an anarchic method. He poses the apparently simple but not-so-innocuous question:&nbsp;How does science differ from witchcraft? He demonstrates how&nbsp;Galileo used rhetoric, propaganda, and various epistemological artifices&nbsp; to support the heliocentric position. Agnes Heller, author of&nbsp;A&nbsp;Theory of History&nbsp;conceptualizes the idea of &#39;chance&#39; as a significant element of historical method. She draws on&nbsp;Jules Verne&rsquo;s book Captain Grant&rsquo;s Children (1867), where the children find a bottle in a the belly of a shark. The bottle has a message which is wet and not fully decipherable. They find the lost ship (from which the bottle with the note came) completely by chance and not by&nbsp;piecing together the evidence. Similarly, Marshall Sahlins writes about the significance of &#39;co-incidence&#39; and Carlo Ginzburg about &#39;conjecture&#39; as central element of historical method. I am imagining this seminar as a lively conversation that we will have as we read and engage with these books. The objective is to think deeply about the historian&rsquo;s craft and to understand one&#39;s own practice. Please join the course only if you are willing to read deeply and if you enjoy conversations.</p>\n\n<p>Class Format: Each student is expected to &lsquo;adopt&rsquo; two texts (one before the mid-term and one after) and come prepared to present the main questions the books raise, their arguments, the sources they draw on and the vantage point of the historian, and finally what they made of the text.</p>\n\n<p>The books:</p>\n\n<p>1.

Seneca spoke disparagingly of those who taught us how to argue rather than how to live. For Montaigne, our duty was to compose our characters rather than books. The Buddhist eight-fold path was not a speculation of merely intellectual import, but intended as a guide for the right way to live. The arguments of the&nbsp;Analects&nbsp;were intended to indicate a path towards&nbsp;self-cultivation.&nbsp;In this course, we will study the various ways in which philosophy can be conceived of as a way of life. We will also consider whether such conceptions of philosophy can be valuable, or even defensible, in the twenty-first century.

Vast parts of this world were integral to an expanding&nbsp;&nbsp; Ottoman Empire that began its innings in the 13th century and survived until the first world war. It was this Ottoman world that left its indelible impression on the modern Middle East when the post war British mandates framed the region.</p>\n\n<p>This course studies the making of the Ottoman Empire from the 13th to the beginning of the 18th centuries to offer historical insights to the making of the modern Middle East. &nbsp;It focusses on the complex network of alliances, and forms of communication that sustained and reproduced empires in the pluralistic and diverse socio-cultural settings embraced by the early Ottomans. It discusses the making of Ottoman political sovereignty and economy in the early modern period in the backdrop of the many challenges faced by the Empire.</p>\n\n<p>The course has a comparative edge, and encourages us to think about the deep cultural and intellectual affinities that the Ottoman empire had with the Mughals and the Safavids in India and Iran respectively. It throws light on how these trans- imperial entanglements help us under better the geo-politics of the modern Middle East world.</p>\n\n<p>Schedule</p>\n\n<p>Week 1-2: Introduction &amp; &nbsp;Asia Minor Before the Ottomans: An Overview</p>\n\n<p>Week 3-4: The Early Ottomans: The idea of frontier and gazi.</p>\n\n<p>Week 5-6: Disintegration and Reintegration: Fall of Constantinople /Conquest of Istanbul (1453).</p>\n\n<p>Week 7-8: &nbsp;Centralization and its discontents: key institutions</p>\n\n<p>Week 9-10: The making of Imperial Sovereignty</p>\n\n<p>Week 11-12: Interpretations of Ottoman Economy</p>\n\n<p>Week 13 Ottoman court culture</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>A good historical understanding of the Middle East politics.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Evaluation: 25% class discussions; 25% mid -term assignment; 50% end term assignment</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Essential Readings</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Week 1-2; The objective of this unit is to acquaint the students with the political culture in the region before the emergence of the Ottoman empire</p>\n\n<p>Albert Hourani, The Emergence of the Modern Middle East (London: Macmillan, 1981)</p>\n\n<p>Speros Jr. Vryonis, The Decline of Medieval Hellinism in Asia Minor and the Process of Islamization from the Eleventh through the Fifteenth Century (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971), pp.69-133.</p>\n\n<p>David Morgan, Medieval Persia, 1040-1797 (London: Routledge, 1988), 25-33</p>\n\n<p>S.

The courses are designed particularly to equip PhD students in reading and interpreting historical texts for their research.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Classical Persian Texts and Contexts</strong><br />\nPersian literature written before the nineteenth century differs from modern literature both in form and content. The language of classical Persian literature is replete with Arabic words and literary phrases. They also have rich literary embellishments and artistic expressions. All this makes these texts very different from modern Persian texts. This course introduces these classical Persian texts to the students. It trains them to analyse these texts from a literary point of view and to enhance their skill of reading them in their historical contexts. This course will help the students negotiate the texts, documents, and archival materials of medieval and early modern periods in their PhD research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />\n<strong>Codicology</strong><br />\nMuseums, libraries, and archives are full of Persian manuscripts and documents which are treasure houses of information and knowledge about the past. These Persian texts were written in various scripts by scribes, artists, statesmen, poets, and writers. Aside from texts, there are also additional documentary material &ndash; like flyleaf, colophon, endorsements, and seals &ndash; that are useful to understand the past. Many of these texts are not legible and can be read only by experienced readers. One of the challenges of modern times is to discern these writings and make the texts legible and translate them into English or vernacular languages. Many of the manuscripts lying in archival collection are still waiting for their readers, editors, and translators. As such, they are hidden from the public domain. This course on codicology will train research students in reading these manuscripts and using them for historical and literary research.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Inscriptions</strong><br />\nIn medieval India, the usage of Persian language was not limited to the writings of administrative documents and literature; it was also used to write inscriptions on walls of forts, tablets of mosques, tombs, and gardens. Inscriptions in Persian language also adorned many swords, knives, armours, and cannons.&nbsp; Coins minted by the rulers also bear inscriptions in Persian. Museums and archives have vast collections of such coins and artifacts. All these inscriptions comprise extremely valuable sources for historical research and can be read only by trained scholars. This course equips research students to read and interpret inscriptional records to decode the past.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>The course enables PhD students of History to read and understand the Persian sources</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Relevant Persian Manuscripts and sources to be used by the PhD students in their researches shall be taught in the classes.&nbsp;</p>\n </div></div>",

This course is a virtual journey across the world, to study, view, and curate films that have made an impact globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This course examines key theoretical and critical concepts, as well as debates, that are essential for a comprehensive historical and contextual understanding of World Cinema. It emphasizes contemporary developments and case studies through specific films, regions, and/or directors. The current period is widely regarded by critics as a golden age for emerging &quot;new cinemas,&quot; directors, and transnational trends, including popular exportable genres, new multicultural genres like migrant and accented cinema, &quot;new&quot; realisms, and &quot;slow cinema.&quot; Recently, World Cinema Studies and Transnational Film Studies have emerged as distinct academic fields. The aim of this course is to provide you with a well-rounded understanding of the diverse range of World Cinemas beyond the structures of&nbsp;Hollywood, exploring the transnational and transcultural contexts of production, circulation, consumption, and reception of &quot;World Cinema&quot; films today. These aspects have been shaped by factors such as new digital technologies, the internet, global media convergence, economic and cultural globalization, and political transformations, all of which will be addressed in this&nbsp;course. Alongside a theoretical and analytical component, the course will also introduce you to practical notions of curatorship, to&nbsp; understand how the exhibition industry works in relation to creative programmes of world cinema. Some of the key films we will study are from regions such as Africa, Italy, Iran, Korea, and China, among others.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p><strong>On completion of this course, students will be able to</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>1. Gain an understanding of key theoretical and critical concepts, models and debates relevant to the study of both national cinemas and transnational developments within World Cinemas, and had opportunities to apply these. (Research Dossier, Curatorial programme, and audio-visual diary).</p>\n\n<p>2. Engage in depth with selected film/cinema case studies (national, transnational, thematic/issue based, or director-focused). (Research Dossier and Curatorial programme).</p>\n\n<p>3. Gain an informed sense of the institutional, economic, political, cultural and wider contextual issues around contemporary &lsquo;World&rsquo; filmmaking (from questions of history, identity and representation to the impacts of globalisation and new technologies) and the ways in which these may shape the themes, style, production, circulation and reception of non-Hollywood &lsquo;World Cinema&rsquo; films. (Research Dossier and Curatorial Programme).</p>\n\n<p>4. Build competence in, selecting and applying relevant concepts, arguments and contextual understanding appropriately in (i) discussion and evaluation of trends, movements and/or case studies within World Cinema at national and transnational levels, and (ii) critical discussion and/or textual analysis of specific films. (Research Dossier and Curatorial programme).</p>\n\n<p>5.

While the idea of the digital may be used to refer to binary connections, the computational, electronic, or anything that is internet mediated, ethnographers are interested in the imbrications of these technologies in everyday life and the consequences of the digital for the human condition- in online worlds and in their entanglements with lived realities in physical places. Ethnographic approaches in other words help us explore human interactions with digital devices, the making of human connections in cyberspace, coproduction of notions of the real and the virtual, or the conditions of living and being in a digital culture- that might be called `digitality&rsquo;. We will examine possibilities of these human engagements in diverse sites and contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The course will be taught over three sections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We first chart some of the conceptual dilemmas in the terrain. How do we approach understandings of `digitality&rsquo;? In what ways may the digital mediate human life and culture? Are they any different from prior mediations?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The second section engages with methodological contestations that ethnographers of digital media grapple with. These include existent questions of power, subjectivity, or reflexivity in ethnography in general, but also those that address specific dilemmas in digital ethnography. What does it mean to do ethnography in digital worlds? What may be its analytic advantage to study sociality or politics? Can virtual worlds be studied on their own terms- without ethnographic engagement in the physical worlds that actors in digital places also belong to? What does it mean to conduct multi-sited or multi-timed fieldwork on specific congeries of media practices, forms and agents? How does ethnography help us approach closer towards understandings of digital media in everyday life that is &lsquo;non-media-centric&rsquo;? Can the study of media beyond media content, as part of the sensory, embodied and affective routines of everyday life, help us arrive at thicker understandings of the possible role of media in social life and change?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we engage with a range of ethnographic studies of lived histories and vernacular cultures of digital media, exploring local meanings to digital genres of gaming, memes, blogging, or hacking for instance, but also their intersections with existing cultures of class, difference, disability, gender and sexuality etc.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students will acquire a theoretical grasp and methodological acquaintance with:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1. Digitality and its (ethnographic) Dilemmas&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2. Ethnography in/ of Virtual Worlds&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3. Ethnographic Contexts&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>",

We will talk mostly about the equity market, but later we will also discuss options (puts &amp; calls). The course revolves around different models, methods, and approaches that&nbsp;might&nbsp;help us identify mispriced financial assets which in turn&nbsp;could&nbsp;help us design a reasonably good portfolio. These methods and models have some kind of economic or accounting rationale behind&nbsp;them and some of them are based on groundbreaking papers published in the last century. Despite all that, a student in this course would eventually come to realize that no one model/ method is enough to help us understand the true value of a financial asset. In fact, it is extremely hard to explain why a given object has a particular value and check whether that object is overpriced/ underpriced. Renowned statistician, George Box once said - &quot;all models are wrong, but some are useful&quot;. That is what we will try to do in this course - study some models that have been useful in the context of asset pricing. To be specific, we will start with a modern interpretation of Talmudic investing strategy, Markowitz portfolio selection (and maybe some of the later&nbsp;variants if time or your interest permits), factor/ index models, capital asset pricing model (CAPM), and its variants, arbitrage pricing theory, Fama-French three-factor model (maybe briefly discuss the more recent 5-factor model), efficient market hypothesis, equity valuation models, and later we will study options, put-call parity, Black-Scholes&#39; options pricing.<br />\n<br />\nThis is a rigorous course, a math- and statistics-based course.

The course provides a critical overview of development theories, including classical political economy, modernization theory, dependency theory, postdevelopmentalism, feminist theories of development, sustainable development, and so on. It traces the ideas of development from the 19th century onward, with a particular focus on development thinking in the post-World War II period. At the same time, the course examines certain development projects for a more grounded understanding of how &ldquo;development&rdquo; occurs, to whose benefit, and why there is little consensus on what development entails. The course also engages with the multiple ways in which development processes interact with and reshape the environment, thereby affecting the realities of people around the world, and the Global South in particular. To this end, the course specifically focuses on debates and theories around sustainability. It problematizes the idea of sustainability in a world governed by neoliberal development paradigm and faced with both environmental crises and injustices. Upon completing this course, students are expected to learn:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>a. A set of theoretical tools and analytical lenses by which to understand the processes, relationships, and phenomena involved in what we call &ldquo;development&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustainability.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>b.

It especially looks at the categories of &lsquo;masculinity&rsquo; and &lsquo; femininity&rsquo;, how these were constructed and mapped during the period, in relation to one another. In doing so, it considers how evolving ideals of manliness came to inform kingship and domesticity in the Sultanate and the Mughal period. To what extent was the courtly and domestic spaces segregated? What were the ways in which the royal women responded and negotiated with the prescribed norms and participate in politics and court society ? How had art and architectural productions served as sites of gendered patronage, aesthetics, labour and performance ? These are some of the questions that we will address in this course. The course will also explore the non-royal social and political groups, the concubines, dancing girls, women slaves and labourers as well as the gender-liminal figure of the eunuch. The processes of gender marginalisation and defiance of gender normativity will also be taken up, particularly through a study of some of the women saints who challenged societal hierarchies in their pursuit of spirituality. The course will culminate with a discussion on how the medieval notions of gender normativity were reoriented and subverted at the wake of colonialism in the eighteenth century.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students will be expected to prepare&nbsp;and discuss one reading of approximately 30-40 pages for each class.

Students will learn to interpret architecture as both cultural expression and technical accomplishment. The creation of a city reflects a society&rsquo;s power, wealth, knowledge, and imagination, often embodying its aspirations through the built environment, spatial organization, and ecological relationships. In Islamicate cultures moreover, oral narratives, Sufi lyric traditions, and illustrated manuscripts are crucial in defining cities. They shape the discourses through which cities are perceived and remembered. This course integrates architectural, visual, poetic, and narrative materials that inform the spatial imagination of early modern South Asian cities.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students will learn to:</p>\n\n<p>1.

It will move beyond the colonial definition of history as a rational-positivist discipline towards highlighting the literariness of historical writing in the period under study. In the process, the course will introduce the students to a dynamic&nbsp; multilingual world where linguistic-literary groups and forms existed in constant circulation and interaction with one another, and historical narratives encompassed multiplicity of languages and literary genres. As case in point, the course will take up several literary and language traditions, notably the &lsquo;courtly&rsquo; languages of Persian and Sanskrit, along with Marathi, Bengali, Brajbhasha and other vernaculars, which had all flourished in tandem with the political culture of the medieval-early modern period. To what extent did these literary narratives inform the formulation of regional, ethnic and devotional identities? Who were the scribes and the poets? How did the material medium of paper facilitate this literary flourish? These are some of the questions that this course will address. The course will culminate by charting the rise of Urdu literary tradition as reflective of the political flux of the eighteenth century. By the end of the course, students will have an overview of the literary history of history writing in medieval and early modern South Asia.</p>\n</div></div><div><strong>Requirements (Reading List and other materials)</strong><div class='cmsDescp'><p>Students will be expected to prepare&nbsp;and discuss one reading of approximately 30-40 pages for each class.
